CHAPTER SEVEN
GRAVITATION
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Early in our lives, we become aware of the tendency of all
material objects to be attracted towards the earth.  Anything
thrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot
more tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds
above fall towards the earth and  there are many other such
phenomena.  Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo
(1564-1642) who recognised the fact that all bodies,
irrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth
with a constant acceleration.  It is said  that he made a public
demonstration of this fact.  To find the truth, he certainly
did experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and
arrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is
close to the more accurate value obtained later.
A seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars,
planets and their motion has been the subject of attention
in many countries since the earliest of times.  Observations
since early times recognised stars which appeared in the
sky with positions unchanged year after year.  The more
interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular
motions against the background of stars.  The earliest
recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy
about 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all
celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved
around the earth.  The only motion that was thought to be
possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle.
Complicated schemes of motion  were put forward by Ptolemy
in order to describe the observed motion of the planets.  The
planets were described as moving in circles with the centre
of the circles themselves moving in larger circles.  Similar
theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some
400 years later.  However a more elegant model in which the
Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved – the
‘heliocentric’ model – was already mentioned by Aryabhatta
(5th century A.D.) in his treatise. A thousand years later, a
Polish monk named Nicolas Copernicus (1473-1543)

proposed a definitive model in which the planets
moved in circles around a fixed central sun.  His
theory was discredited by the church, but
notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who
had to face prosecution from the state for his
beliefs.
It was around the same time as Galileo, a
nobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)
hailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime
recording observations of the planets with the
naked eye.  His compiled data were analysed
later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (1571-
1640). He could extract from the data three
elegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler’s
laws.  These laws were known to Newton and
enabled him to make a great scientific leap in
proposing his universal law of gravitation.
7.2  KEPLER’S LAWS
The three laws of Kepler can be stated as
follows:
1.  Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical
orbits with the Sun situated at one of the  foci
Fig. 7.1(a) An ellipse traced out by a planet around
the sun. The closest point is P and the
farthest point is A, P is called the
perihelion and A the aphelion. The
semimajor axis is half the distance AP.

fixed at F1 and F2. The tip of a pencil holds
the string taut and is moved around.
of the ellipse (Fig. 7.1a). This law was a
deviation from the Copernican model which
allowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of
which the circle is a special case, is a closed
curve which can be drawn very simply as
follows.
Select two points F1 and F2.  Take a length
of a string and  fix its ends at F1 and F2 by
pins.  With the tip of a pencil  stretch the string
taut and then draw a curve by moving the
pencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig.
7.1(b))  The closed curve you get is called an
ellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse,
the sum of the distances from F1 and F2 is a
constant.  F1, F2 are called the focii. Join the
points F1 and  F2  and extend   the line to
intersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown
in Fig. 7.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is
the centre of the ellipse O and the length PO =
AO  is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse.
For a circle, the two focii  merge into one  and
the semi-major axis becomes the radius of the
circle.
2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet
to the sun sweeps  equal areas in equal
intervals of time (Fig. 7.2).  This law comes from
the observations that planets appear to move
slower when they are  farther from the sun
than when they are nearer.
Fig. 7.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an
elliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area
∆A swept out in a small interval of time  ∆t.

3. Law of periods : The square of the time period
of revolution of a planet is proportional to the
cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced
out by  the planet.
Table 7.1 gives the approximate time periods
of revolution of eight* planets around the sun
along with values of their semi-major axes.

The law of areas can be understood as a
consequence of  conservation of angular
momentum whch is valid for any central
force . A central force is such that  the force
on the planet is along the vector joining the
Sun and the planet. Let the Sun be at the
origin and let the position and momentum
of the planet be denoted by r and p
respectively. Then the area swept out by the
planet of mass m in time interval ∆t is (Fig.
7.2) ∆A given by
∆A  = ½  (r × v∆t)
(7.1)
 Hence
∆A /∆t   =½ (r × p)/m, (since  v = p/m)
                       =    L / (2 m)
(7.2)
where v is the velocity,  L is the angular
momentum equal  to   ( r  ×  p).  For a central
force, which is directed along r, L is  a constant
as the planet goes around. Hence,  ∆A /∆t is a
constant according to the last equation. This is
the law of areas. Gravitation is a central force
and hence the law of areas follows.
Example 7.1  Let  the speed of the planet
at  the  perihelion P in Fig. 7.1(a) be vP  and
the Sun-planet distance SP be rP. Relate
{rP, vP} to the corresponding quantities at
the aphelion {rA, vA}. Will the planet take
equal times to traverse BAC and CPB ?
Answer  The magnitude of the angular
momentum at P is Lp =  mp rp vp, since inspection
tells us that rp and v p are mutually
perpendicular. Similarly, LA = mp rA vA. From
angular momentum conservation
mp rp vp = mp rA vA
or

Since rA   > rp, vp > vA .
The area SBAC bounded by the ellipse and
the radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC
in Fig. 7.1. From Kepler’s second law, equal areas
are swept in equal times. Hence the planet will
take a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB.
7.3  UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION
Legend has it that observing an apple falling from
a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an
universal law of gravitation that led to an
explanation of terrestrial  gravitation as well as
of Kepler’s laws.  Newton’s reasoning was that
the moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was
subject to a centripetal acceleration due to
earth’s gravity of magnitude

. The
time period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was
already known then to be about 3.84 × 108m.  If
we substitute these numbers in Eq. (7.3), we get
a value of am much smaller than the value of
acceleration due to gravity g on the surface of
the earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational
attraction.

This clearly shows that the force due to
earth’s gravity decreases with distance.  If one
assumes that the gravitational force due to the
earth decreases in proportion to the inverse
square of the distance from the centre of the
earth, we will have am α

in agreement with a value of g  9.8  m s-2 and
the value of am from Eq. (7.3).  These observations
led Newton to propose the following Universal Law
of Gravitation :
Every body in the universe attracts every other
body with a force which is directly proportional
to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
The quotation is essentially from Newton’s
famous treatise  called ‘Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short).
Stated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation
law reads : The force F on a point mass m2 due
to another point mass m1 has the magnitude

where G is the universal gravitational constant,
ɵr  is the unit vector from m1 to m2 and r = r2 – r1
as shown in Fig. 7.3.
The  gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the
force F is along – r. The force on point mass m1
due to m2 is of course – F by Newton’s third law.
Thus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1
due to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to 1 are related
as F12 = – F21.
Before we can apply Eq. (7.5) to objects under
consideration, we have to be careful since the
law refers to point masses whereas we deal with
extended objects which have finite size. If we have
a collection of point masses, the force on any
one of them is the vector sum of the gravitational
forces exerted by the other point masses as
shown in Fig 7.4.

vector sum of the gravitational forces exerted
by m2, m3 and m4.

cases, a  simple law results when you do that :
(1)
The force of attraction between a hollow
spherical shell of uniform density and a
point mass situated outside is just as if
the entire mass of the shell is
concentrated at the centre of the shell.
Qualitatively this can be understood as
follows: Gravitational forces caused by the
various regions of the shell have components
along the line joining the point mass to the
centre as well as along a direction
prependicular to this line. The components
prependicular to this line cancel out when
summing over all regions of the shell leaving
only a resultant force along the line joining
the point to the centre. The magnitude of
this force works out to be as stated above.
(2)
The force of attraction due to a hollow
spherical shell of uniform density, on a
point mass situated inside it is zero.
Qualitatively, we can again understand this
result. Various regions of the spherical shell
attract the point mass inside it in various
directions. These forces cancel each other
completely.
7.4  THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT
The value of the gravitational constant G entering
the Universal law of gravitation  can be
determined experimentally and this was first done
by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.
The apparatus used by him is schematically
shown in Fig.7.6
Fig. 7.6
Schematic drawing of Cavendish’s
experiment. S1 and S2 are large spheres
which are kept on either side (shown
shades) of the masses at A and B. When
the big spheres are taken to the other side
of the masses (shown by dotted circles),
the bar AB rotates a little since the torque
reverses direction. The angle of rotation can
be measured experimentally.

vertices of the ∆ ABC. A mass 2m is placed

For the gravitational force between an extended
object (like the earth) and a point mass, Eq. (7.5) is not
directly applicable. Each point mass in the extended
object will exert a force on the given point mass and
these force will not all be in the same direction. We
have to add up these forces vectorially  for all the point
masses in the extended object to get the total force.

The bar AB has two small lead spheres
attached at its ends.  The bar is suspended from
a rigid support by a fine wire.  Two large lead
spheres are brought close to the small ones but
on opposite sides as shown.  The big spheres
attract the nearby small ones by equal and
opposite force as shown.  There is no net force
on the bar but only a torque which is clearly
equal to F times the length of the bar,where F is
the force of attraction between a big sphere and
its neighbouring small sphere.  Due to this
torque, the suspended wire  gets twisted till such
time as the restoring torque of the wire equals
the gravitational torque .  If θ is the angle of twist
of the suspended wire, the restoring torque is
proportional to θ, equal to τθ. Where τ is the
restoring couple per unit angle of twist. τ can be
measured independently e.g. by applying a
known torque and measuring the angle of twist.
The gravitational force between the spherical
balls is the same as if their masses are
concentrated at their centres.  Thus if d is the
separation between the centres of the big and
its neighbouring small ball, M and m their
masses, the gravitational force between the big
sphere and its neighouring small ball is.

7.5 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF
THE EARTH
The earth can be imagined to be a sphere made
of a large number of concentric spherical shells
with the smallest one at the centre and the
largest one at its surface.  A point outside the
earth  is obviously outside all the shells.  Thus,
all the shells exert a gravitational force at the
point outside just as if their masses are
concentrated at their common centre according
to the result stated in section 7.3. The total mass
of all the shells combined is just the mass of the
earth.  Hence, at a point outside the earth, the
gravitational force is just as if its entire mass of
the earth is concentrated at its centre.
For a point inside the earth, the situation
is different.  This is illustrated in Fig. 7.7.
Fig. 7.7
The mass m is in a mine located at a depth
d below the surface of the Earth of mass
ME and radius RE. We treat the Earth to be
spherically symmetric.
Again consider the earth  to be made up of
concentric shells as before and a point mass m
situated at a distance r from the centre.  The
point  P lies outside the sphere of radius r.  For
the shells of radius greater than r, the point P
lies inside.  Hence according to result stated in
the last section, they exert no gravitational force
on mass m kept at P.  The shells with radius ≤r
make up a sphere of radius r for which the point
P lies on the surface.  This smaller sphere
therefore exerts a force on a mass m at P as if
its mass Mr is concentrated at the centre.  Thus
the force on the mass m at P has a magnitude

Acceleration g is readily measurable.  RE is a

why there is a popular statement regarding
Cavendish : “Cavendish weighed the earth”.
7.6 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY BELOW

Consider a point mass m at a height h above the
surface of the earth as shown in Fig. 7.8(a).  The
radius of the earth is denoted by  RE . Since this
point is outside the earth,

 as shown in the figure.   The
earth can be thought of as being composed
of a smaller sphere of radius  (RE  – d )  and a
spherical shell of thickness d.  The force on
m due to the outer shell of thickness  d is
zero because the result quoted in the
previous section. As far as the smaller
sphere of radius  ( RE  – d  ) is concerned, the
point mass is outside it and hence according
to the result quoted earlier, the force due to
this smaller sphere is just as if the entire
mass of the smaller sphere is concentrated
at the centre. If Ms  is the mass of the smaller
sphere, then,

7.7  GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY
We had discussed earlier the notion of potential
energy as being the energy stored in the body at
its given position.  If the position of the particle
changes on account of forces acting on it, then
the change in its potential energy is just the
amount of work done on the body by the force.
As we had discussed earlier, forces for which the
work done is independent of the path are the
conservative forces.
The force of gravity is a conservative force
and we can calculate the potential energy of a
body arising out of this force, called the
gravitational potential energy. Consider points
close to the surface of earth, at distances from
the surface much smaller than the radius of the
earth.  In such cases, the force of gravity is
practically a constant equal to mg, directed
towards the centre of the earth.  If we consider a
point at a height h1 from the surface of the earth
and another point vertically above it at a height
h2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the
particle of mass m from the first to the second
position is denoted by W12
W12 = Force × displacement
      = mg (h2 – h1)
(7.20)
If we associate a potential energy W(h) at a
point at a height h above the surface such that
W(h) = mgh  + Wo
(7.21)
(where Wo = constant) ;
then it is clear that
W12 = W(h2)  – W(h1)
(7.22)
The work done in moving the particle is just
the difference of potential energy between its
final and initial positions.Observe that the
constant Wo cancels out in Eq. (7.22).  Setting  h
= 0 in the last equation, we get   W ( h = 0 ) =  Wo.
.  h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth.
Thus,  Wo  is the  potential energy on the surface
of the earth.
If we consider points at arbitrary distance
from the surface of the earth, the result just
derived is not valid since the assumption that
the gravitational force mg is a constant is no

where ME = mass of earth, m = mass of the

a vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (7.20)

so that once again W12 = W(r2) – W(r1).
Setting   r = infinity in the last equation, we get
W ( r = infinity ) =   W1 .   Thus,  W1  is the potential
energy at infinity. One should note that only the
difference of potential energy between two points
has a definite meaning  from Eqs. (7.22) and
(7.24). One conventionally sets  W1 equal to zero,
so that the potential energy at a point is just the
amount of work done in displacing the particle
from infinity to that point.
We have  calculated the potential energy at
a point of a particle  due to gravitational forces
on it due to the earth and it is proportional to
the mass of the particle. The gravitational
potential due to the gravitational force of the
earth is defined as the potential energy of  a
particle of unit mass at that point. From the
earlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational
potential energy associated with two particles
of masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a
distance r is given by

It should be noted that an isolated system of
particles will have the total potential energy that
equals the sum of energies (given by the above
equation) for all possible pairs of its constituent
particles. This is an example of the application
of the superposition principle.
Example 7.3  Find the potential energy of
a system of four particles placed at the
vertices of a square of side l. Also obtain
the potential at the centre of the square.
Answer   Consider four masses each of mass m
at the corners of a square of side l; See Fig. 7.9.
We have four mass pairs at distance l and two
diagonal pairs at distance 2 l

7.8  ESCAPE SPEED
If a stone is thrown by hand, we see it falls back
to the earth. Of course using machines we can
shoot an object with much greater speeds and
with greater and greater initial speed, the object
scales higher and higher heights. A natural
query that arises in our mind is the following:
‘can we throw an object with such high initial
speeds that it does not fall back to the earth?’
The principle of conservation of energy helps
us to answer this question. Suppose the object
did reach infinity and that its speed there was
Vf. The energy of an object is the sum of potential
and kinetic energy. As before W1 denotes that
gravitational potential energy of the object at
infinity. The total energy of the projectile at
infinity then is

Using the value of g and RE, numerically
(Vi)min≈11.2 km/s. This is called the escape
speed, sometimes loosely called the escape
velocity.
Equation (7.32) applies equally well to an
object thrown from the surface of the moon with
g replaced by the acceleration due to Moon’s
gravity on its surface and rE replaced by the
radius of the moon. Both are smaller than their
values on earth and the escape speed for the
moon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times
smaller. This is the reason that moon has no
atmosphere. Gas molecules if formed on the
surface of the moon having velocities larger than
this will escape the gravitational pull of the
moon.
Example 7.4  Two uniform solid spheres
of equal radii R, but mass M and 4 M have
a centre to centre separation 6 R, as shown
in Fig. 7.10. The two spheres are held fixed.
A projectile of mass m is projected from the
surface of the sphere of mass M directly
towards the centre of the second sphere.
Obtain an expression for the minimum
speed v of the projectile so that it reaches
the surface of the second sphere.
Fig. 7.10
Answer  The projectile is acted upon by two
mutually opposing gravitational forces of the two
spheres. The neutral point N (see Fig. 7.10) is
defined as the position where the two forces
cancel each other exactly. If ON = r, we have

6R – r = ±2r
r = 2R   or – 6R.
The neutral point r =  – 6R does not concern
us in this example. Thus ON = r = 2R. It is
sufficient to project the particle with a speed
which would enable it to reach N. Thereafter,
the greater gravitational pull of 4M would
suffice. The mechanical energy at the surface

7.9  EARTH SATELLITES
Earth satellites are objects which revolve around
the earth.  Their motion is very similar to the
motion of planets around the Sun and hence
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally
applicable to them.  In particular, their orbits
around the earth are circular or elliptic.  Moon is
the only natural satellite of the earth with a near
circular orbit with a time period of approximately
27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the
rotational period of the moon about its own axis.
Since, 1957, advances in technology have enabled
many countries including India to launch artificial
earth satellites for practical use in fields like
telecommunication, geophysics and meteorology.
We will consider a satellite in a circular orbit
of a distance (RE + h) from the centre of the earth,
where RE = radius of the earth. If m is the mass
of the satellite and V its speed, the centripetal
force required for this orbit is
F(centripetal) =

which is Kepler’s law of periods, as applied to
motion of satellites around the earth. For a
satellite very close to the surface of earth h can
be neglected in comparison to RE in Eq. (7.38).

Note that Eq. (7.38) also holds for elliptical

of the ellipse. The earth will then be at one of
the foci of this ellipse.

The total energy of an circularly orbiting
satellite is thus negative, with the potential
energy being negative but twice is magnitude of
the positive kinetic energy.
When the orbit of a satellite becomes
elliptic, both the K.E. and P.E. vary from point
to point.  The total energy which remains
constant is negative as in the circular orbit case.
This is what we expect, since as we have
discussed before if the total energy is positive or
zero, the object escapes to infinity.   Satellites
are always at finite distance from the earth and
hence their energies cannot be positive or zero.

SUMMARY
1. Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between
any two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r has the magnitude
F
G
m m
r 2
=
1
2
where G is the universal gravitational constant, which has the value  6.672 ×10–11 N m2 kg–2.
2. If we have to find the resultant gravitational force acting on the particle m due to a number of
masses M1, M2, ….Mn etc. we use the principle of superposition. Let F1, F2, ….Fn be the individual
forces due to M1, M2, ….Mn, each given by the law of gravitation. From the principle of superposition
each force acts independently  and uninfluenced by the other bodies. The resultant force FR is
then found by vector addition
FR  =  F1 + F2 + ……+ Fn   =  
Fi
i
n
=
∑
1
where the symbol ‘Σ’ stands for summation.
3. Kepler’s laws of planetary motion state that
(a) All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points
(b) The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time
intervals. This follows from the fact that the force of gravitation on the planet is central
and hence angular momentum is conserved.
(c) The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the   semi-major
axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet

1. In considering motion of an object under the gravitational influence of another object
the following quantities are conserved:
(a)  Angular momentum
(b)  Total mechanical energy
Linear momentum is not conserved
2. Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler’s second law. However, it is not special
to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.
3. In Kepler’s third law (see Eq. (7.1) and  T2 = KS R3. The constant KS is the same for all
planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (7.38)].
4. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the
gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut
and the satellite are in “free fall” towards the Earth.
5. The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance
r is given by
V
G m m
r

constant
The constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With
this choice
V
G m m
r
= –

2
This choice implies that V →  0 as r →  ∞.  Choosing location of zero of the gravitational
energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that
the gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.
6. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always
positive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential
energy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is
negative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.
7. The commonly encountered expression m g h for the potential energy is actually an
approximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the
point 6, above.
8. Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two
finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a
spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if
the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.
9. The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However, (unlike a
metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside
it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not
possible.
EXERCISES
7.1
Answer the following :
(a) You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor.
Can you shield a body from the gravitational influence of nearby matter by putting
it inside a hollow sphere or by some other means ?
(b) An astronaut inside a small space ship orbiting around the earth cannot detect
gravity. If the space station orbiting around the earth has a large size, can he hope
to detect gravity ?
(c) If you compare the gravitational force on the earth due to the sun to that due
to the moon, you would find that the Sun’s pull is greater than the moon’s pull.
(you can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises).
However, the tidal effect of the moon’s pull is greater than the tidal effect of sun.

(d) The formula –G Mm(1/r2  – 1/r1) is more/less accurate than the formula
