13.1  Introduction
We know that statistics deals with data collected for specific
purposes. We can make decisions about the data by
analysing and interpreting it. In earlier classes, we have
studied methods of representing data graphically and in
tabular form. This representation reveals certain salient
features or characteristics of the data. We have also studied
the methods of finding a representative value for the given
data. This value is called the measure of central tendency.
Recall mean (arithmetic mean), median and mode are three
measures of central tendency. A measure of central
tendency gives us a rough idea where data points are
centred. But, in order to make better interpretation from the
data, we should also have an idea how the data are scattered or how much they are
bunched around a measure of central tendency.
Consider now the runs scored by two batsmen in their last ten matches as follows:
Batsman A : 30, 91,  0, 64, 42, 80, 30, 5, 117,  71
Batsman B : 53, 46, 48, 50, 53, 53, 58, 60, 57, 52
Clearly, the mean and median of the data are
Batsman A
Batsman B

Recall that, we calculate the mean of a data (denoted by x ) by dividing the sum
of the observations by the number of observations, i.e.,

order and applying the following rule.
If the number of observations is odd, then the median is

We find that the mean and median of the runs scored by both the batsmen A and
B are same i.e., 53. Can we say that the performance of two players is same? Clearly
No, because the variability in the scores of batsman A is from 0 (minimum) to 117
(maximum). Whereas, the range of the runs scored by batsman B is from 46 to 60.
Let us now plot the above scores as dots on a number line. We find the following
diagrams:
For batsman A
For batsman B
We can see that the dots corresponding to batsman B are close to each other and
are clustering around the measure of central tendency (mean and median), while those
corresponding to batsman A are scattered or more spread out.
Thus, the measures of central tendency are not sufficient to give complete
information about a given data. Variability is another factor which is required to be
studied under statistics. Like ‘measures of central tendency’ we want to have a
single number to describe variability. This single number is called a ‘measure of
dispersion’. In this Chapter, we shall learn some of the important measures of dispersion
and their methods of calculation for ungrouped and grouped data.

13.2  Measures of Dispersion
The dispersion or scatter in a data is measured on the basis of the observations and the
types of the measure of central tendency, used there. There are following measures of
dispersion:
(i) Range, (ii) Quartile deviation, (iii) Mean deviation, (iv) Standard deviation.
In this Chapter, we shall study all of these measures of dispersion except the
quartile deviation.
13.3
Range
Recall that, in the example of runs scored by two batsmen A and B, we had some idea
of variability in the scores on the basis of minimum and maximum runs in each series.
To obtain a single number for this, we find the difference of maximum and minimum
values of each series. This difference is called the ‘Range’ of the data.
In case of batsman A, Range = 117 – 0 = 117 and for batsman B, Range = 60 – 46 = 14.
Clearly, Range of A > Range of B. Therefore, the scores are scattered or dispersed in
case of A while for B these are close to each other.
Thus, Range of a series = Maximum value – Minimum value.
The range of data gives us a rough idea of variability or scatter but does not tell
about the dispersion of the data from a measure of central tendency. For this purpose,
we need some other measure of variability. Clearly, such measure must depend upon
the difference (or deviation) of the values from the central tendency.
The important measures of dispersion, which depend upon the deviations of the
observations from a central tendency are mean deviation and standard deviation. Let
us discuss them in detail.
13.4
Mean Deviation
Recall that the deviation of an observation x from a fixed value ‘a’ is the difference
x – a. In order to find the dispersion of values of x from a central value ‘a’ , we find the
deviations about a. An absolute measure of dispersion is the mean of these deviations.
To find the mean, we must obtain the sum of the deviations. But, we know that a
measure of central tendency lies between the maximum and the minimum values of
the set of observations. Therefore, some of the deviations will be negative and some
positive. Thus, the sum of deviations may vanish. Moreover, the sum of the deviations
from mean ( x ) is zero.
Also

Thus, finding the mean of deviations about  mean is not of any use for us, as far
as the measure of dispersion is concerned.

MATHEMATICS
Remember that, in finding a suitable measure of dispersion, we require the distance
of each value from a central tendency or a fixed number ‘a’. Recall, that the absolute
value of the difference of two numbers gives the distance between the numbers when
represented on a number line. Thus, to find the measure of dispersion from a fixed
number ‘a’ we may take the mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the
central value. This mean is called the ‘mean deviation’. Thus mean deviation about a
central value ‘a’  is the mean of the absolute values of the deviations of the observations
from ‘a’. The mean deviation from ‘a’ is denoted as M.D. (a). Therefore,
M.D.(a) = Sum of absolute values of deviations from ' '

Remark  Mean deviation may be obtained from any measure of central tendency.
However, mean deviation from mean and median are commonly used in statistical
studies.
Let us now learn how to calculate mean deviation about mean and mean deviation
about median for various types of data
13.4.1  Mean deviation for ungrouped data  Let  n observations be x1, x2, x3, ...., xn.
The following steps are involved in the calculation of mean deviation about mean or
median:
Step 1 Calculate the measure of central tendency about which we are to find the mean
deviation. Let it be ‘a’.
Step 2  Find the deviation of each xi from a, i.e., x1 – a, x2 – a, x3 – a,. . . , xn– a

two ways :
(a) Discrete frequency distribution,
(b) Continuous frequency distribution.
Let us discuss the method of finding mean deviation for both types of the data.
(a)  Discrete frequency distribution  Let the given data consist of n distinct values
x1, x2, ..., xn occurring with frequencies f1, f2 , ..., fn respectively. This data can be
represented in the tabular form as given below, and is called discrete frequency
distribution:

the observation whose cumulative frequency is equal to or just greater than 
N

N is the sum of frequencies. This value of the observation lies in the middle of the data,
therefore, it is the required median. After finding median, we obtain the mean of the

Shortcut method for calculating mean deviation about mean We can avoid the
tedious calculations of computing x by following step-deviation method. Recall that in
this method, we take an assumed mean which is in the middle or just close to it in the
data. Then deviations of the observations (or mid-points of classes) are taken from the
Reprint 2025-26
   STATISTICS            267
assumed mean. This is nothing but the shifting of origin from zero to the assumed mean
on the number line, as shown in Fig 13.3
If there is a common factor of all the deviations, we divide them by this common
factor to further simplify the deviations. These are known as step-deviations. The
process of taking step-deviations is the change of scale on the number line as shown in
Fig 13.4
The deviations and step-deviations reduce the size of the observations, so that the
computations viz. multiplication,  etc., become simpler. Let, the new variable be denoted
by 
h

(ii) Mean deviation about  median The process of finding the mean deviation about
median for a continuous frequency distribution is similar as we did for mean deviation
about the mean. The only difference lies in the replacement of the mean by median
while taking deviations.
Let us recall the process of finding  median for a continuous frequency distribution.
The data is first arranged in ascending order. Then, the median of continuous
frequency distribution is obtained by first identifying the class in which median lies
(median class) and then applying the formula

13.4.3  Limitations of mean deviation  In a series, where the degree of variability is
very high, the median is not a representative central tendency. Thus, the mean deviation
about median calculated for such series can not be fully relied.
The sum of the deviations from the mean (minus signs ignored) is more than the sum
of the deviations from median. Therefore, the mean deviation about the mean is not very
scientific.Thus, in many cases, mean deviation may give unsatisfactory results. Also mean
deviation is calculated on the basis of absolute values of the deviations and therefore,
cannot be subjected to further algebraic treatment. This implies that we must have some
other measure of dispersion. Standard deviation is such a measure of dispersion.
13.5
Variance and Standard Deviation
Recall that while calculating mean deviation about mean or median, the absolute values
of the deviations were taken. The absolute values were taken to give meaning to the
mean deviation, otherwise the deviations may cancel among themselves.
Another way to overcome this difficulty which arose due to the signs of deviations,
is to take squares of all the deviations. Obviously all these squares of deviations are

close to the mean x and therefore, there is a lower degree of dispersion. On the
contrary, if this sum is large, there is a higher degree of dispersion of the observations

mean of these observations is y = 30

 is simply our measure of dispersion or scatter about mean, we
will tend to say that the set A of six observations has a lesser dispersion about the mean
than the set B of 31 observations, even though the observations in set A are more
scattered from the mean (the range of deviations being from –25 to 25) than in the set
B (where the range of deviations is from –15 to 15).
This is also clear from the following diagrams.
For the set A, we have
For the set B, we have

measure of dispersion. To overcome this difficulty we take the mean of the squares of

13.5.1  Standard Deviation In the calculation of variance, we find that the units of
individual observations xi and the unit of their mean x are different from that of variance,
since variance involves the sum of squares of  (xi– x ). For this reason, the  proper
measure of dispersion about the mean of a set of observations is expressed as positive
square-root of the variance and is called standard deviation. Therefore, the standard
deviation, usually denoted by σ , is given by

13.5.4.  Shortcut method to find variance and standard deviation Sometimes the
values of xi in a discrete distribution or the mid points xi of different classes in a
continuous distribution are large and so the calculation of mean and variance becomes
tedious and time consuming. By using step-deviation method, it is possible to simplify
the procedure.
Let the assumed mean be ‘A’ and the scale be reduced to h
1
 times (h being the
width of class-intervals). Let the step-deviations or the new values be yi.

Therefore

But from (1), we have

x2 + y2  –  2xy = 97 – 72  i.e.  (x – y)2 = 25

So, from (1) and (5), we get
x = 9, y = 4 when x – y = 5
or
x = 4, y = 9 when x – y = – 5
Thus, the remaining observations are 4 and 9.

Historical Note
‘Statistics’ is derived from the Latin word ‘status’ which means a political
state. This suggests that statistics is as old as human civilisation. In the year 3050
B.C., perhaps the first census was held in Egypt. In India also, about 2000 years
ago, we had an efficient system of collecting administrative statistics, particularly,
during the regime of Chandra Gupta Maurya (324-300 B.C.). The system of
collecting data related to births and deaths is mentioned in Kautilya’s Arthshastra
(around 300 B.C.) A detailed account of administrative surveys conducted during
Akbar’s regime is given in Ain-I-Akbari written by Abul Fazl.
Captain John Graunt of London (1620-1674) is known as father of vital
statistics due to his studies on statistics of births and deaths. Jacob Bernoulli
(1654-1705) stated the Law of Large numbers in his book “Ars Conjectandi’,
published in 1713.

The theoretical development of statistics came during the mid seventeenth
century and continued after that with the introduction of theory of games and
chance (i.e., probability). Francis Galton (1822-1921), an Englishman, pioneered
the use of statistical methods, in the field of Biometry. Karl Pearson (1857-1936)
contributed a lot to the development of statistical studies with his discovery
of Chi square test and foundation of statistical laboratory in England (1911).
Sir Ronald A. Fisher (1890-1962), known as the Father of modern statistics,
applied it to various diversified fields such as Genetics, Biometry, Education,
Agriculture, etc.
