11.1  Introduction
In Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two
dimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional
geometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In
the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some
basic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra
to three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this
approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the
study simple and elegant*.
In this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines
and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also
discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space
under different conditions, angle between two lines, two
planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two
skew lines and distance of a point from a plane. Most of
the above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless, we shall also translate
these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric
and analytic picture of the situation.
11.2  Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line
From Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes
angles α, β and γ with x, y and z-axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine
of these angles, namely, cos α, cos β and cos γ are called direction cosines of the
directed line L.
If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements,
i.e., 
, 
 and 
. Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed.

Note that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it
has two sets of direction cosines. In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for
a given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique
direction cosines are denoted by l, m and n.
Remark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find
its direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line.
Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two
parallel line have same set of direction cosines.
Any three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are
called the direction ratios of the line. If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are
direction ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R.
ANote   Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers.
Let a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines
(d.c’s) of the line. Then
l
a  = m
b  = n
k
c =
 (say), k being a constant.
Therefore
l = ak, m = bk, n = ck
... (1)
But
l2 + m2 + n2 = 1
Therefore
k2 (a2 + b2 + c2) = 1
or
k =

where, depending on the desired sign of k, either a positive or a negative sign is to be
taken for l, m and n.
For any line, if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ka, kb, kc; k ≠ 0 is also a
set of direction ratios. So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional.
Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios.
11.2.1  Direction cosines of a line passing through two points
Since one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the
direction cosines of a line passing through the given points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2)
as follows (Fig 11.2 (a)).
Fig 11.2
Let l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and  γ
with the x, y and z-axis, respectively.
Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a
perpendicular from P to QS to meet at N. Now, in right angle triangle PNQ, ∠PQN= γ
(Fig 11.2 (b).

Example 4 Find the direction cosines of x, y and z-axis.
Solution The x-axis makes angles 0°, 90° and 90° respectively with x, y and z-axis.
Therefore, the direction cosines of x-axis are cos 0°, cos 90°, cos 90° i.e., 1,0,0.
Similarly, direction cosines of y-axis and z-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively.
Example 5 Show that the points A (2, 3, – 4), B (1, – 2, 3) and C (3, 8, – 11) are
collinear.
Solution Direction ratios of line joining A and B are
1 – 2, – 2 – 3, 3 + 4 i.e., – 1, – 5, 7.
The direction ratios of line joining B and C are
3 –1, 8 + 2, – 11 – 3, i.e., 2, 10, – 14.
It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel
to BC. But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A, B, C are
collinear points.

11.3 Equation of a Line in Space
We have studied equation of  lines in two dimensions in Class XI, we shall now study
the vector and cartesian equations of a line in space.
A line is uniquely determined if
(i)
it passes through a given point and has given direction, or
(ii)
it passes through two given points.
11.3.1
Equation of a line through a given point and parallel to  given vector 
Let  be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the
rectangular coordinate system. Let l be the line which passes through the point A and
is parallel to a given vector . Let   be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the
line (Fig 11.3).

the line be a, b, c. Consider the coordinates of any point P be (x, y, z). Then

11.5  Shortest Distance between Two Lines
If two lines in space intersect at a point,
then the shortest distance between them is
zero. Also, if two lines in space are parallel,
then the shortest distance between them
will be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the
length of the perpendicular drawn from a
point on one line onto the other line.
Further, in a space, there are lines which
are neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact,
such pair of lines are non coplanar and
are called skew lines. For example, let us
consider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along
x, y and z-axes respectively Fig 11.5.

The line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through
one corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall. These
lines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet.
By the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line
with one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the
smallest.
For skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both
the lines.
11.5.1  Distance between two skew lines
We now determine the shortest distance between two skew lines in the following way:
Let l1 and l2  be two skew lines with equations (Fig. 11.6)

r

    ... (1)
and

r

  ... (2)
Take any point S on l1 with position vector 1ar
 and T on l2, with position vector  
2
ar .
Then the magnitude of the shortest distance vector
will be equal to that of the projection of ST along the
direction of the line of shortest distance (See 10.6.2).
If  PQ

 is the shortest distance vector between l1
and l2 , then it being perpendicular to both  1

the unit vector nˆ  along PQ

11.5.2 Distance between parallel lines
If two lines l1 and  l2 are parallel, then they are coplanar.  Let the lines be given by
... (1)
and
… (2)
where, 1ar is the position vector of a point S on l1 and  
2
ar
is the position vector of a point T on l2 Fig 11.7.
As l1, l2 are coplanar, if the foot of the perpendicular
from T on the line l1 is P, then the distance between the
lines l1 and l2 =  |TP|.
Let θ be the angle between the vectors ST

Summary
® Direction cosines of a line are the cosines of the angles made by the line
with the positive directions of the coordinate axes.
® If l, m, n are the direction cosines of a line, then l2 + m2 + n2 = 1.
® Direction cosines of a line joining two points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2) are
