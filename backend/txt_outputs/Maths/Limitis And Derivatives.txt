12.1  Introduction
This chapter is an introduction to Calculus. Calculus is that
branch of mathematics which mainly deals with the study
of change in the value of a function as the points in the
domain change. First, we give an intuitive idea of derivative
(without actually defining it). Then we give a naive definition
of limit and study some algebra of limits. Then we come
back to a definition of derivative and study some algebra
of derivatives. We also obtain derivatives of certain
standard functions.
12.2  Intuitive Idea of Derivatives
Physical experiments have confirmed that the body dropped
from a tall cliff covers a distance of 4.9t2 metres in t seconds,
i.e., distance s in metres covered by the body as a function of time t in seconds is given
by s = 4.9t2.
The adjoining Table 13.1 gives the distance travelled in metres at various intervals
of time in seconds of a body dropped from a tall cliff.
The objective is to find the veloctiy of the body at time t = 2 seconds from this
data. One way to approach this problem is to find the average velocity for various
intervals of time ending at t = 2 seconds and hope that these throw some light on the
velocity at t = 2 seconds.
Average velocity between t = t1 and t = t2 equals distance travelled between
 t = t1 and t = t2  seconds divided by  (t2 – t1). Hence the average velocity in the first
two seconds

Likewise we compute the average velocitiy

From Table 12.2, we observe that the average velocity is gradually increasing.
As we make the time intervals ending at t = 2 smaller, we see that we get a better idea
of the velocity at t = 2. Hoping that nothing really dramatic happens between 1.99
seconds and 2 seconds, we conclude that the average velocity at t = 2 seconds is just
above 19.551m/s.
This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the following set of computation.
Compute the average velocities for various time intervals starting at t = 2 seconds. As
before the average velocity v between t = 2 seconds and t = t2 seconds is

Here again we note that if we take smaller time intervals starting at t = 2, we get
better idea of the velocity at t = 2.
In the first set of computations, what we have done is to find average velocities
in increasing time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens
just before t = 2. In the second set of computations, we have found the average velocities
decreasing in time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens
just after t = 2. Purely on the physical grounds, both these sequences of average
velocities must approach a common limit. We can safely conclude that the velocity of
the body at t = 2 is between 19.551m/s and 19.649 m/s. Technically, we say that the
instantaneous velocity at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. As is
well-known, velocity is the rate of change of displacement. Hence what we have
accomplished is the following. From the given data of distance covered at various time
instants we have estimated the rate of
change of the distance at a given instant
of time. We say that the derivative of
the distance function s = 4.9t2 at t = 2
is between 19.551 and 19.649.
An alternate way of viewing this
limiting process is shown in Fig 12.1.
This is a plot of distance s of the body
from the top of the cliff versus the time
t elapsed. In the limit as the sequence
of time intervals h1, h2, ..., approaches
zero, the sequence of average velocities
approaches the same limit as does the
sequence of ratios

where C1B1 = s1 – s0 is the distance travelled by the body in the time interval h1 = AC1,
etc. From the Fig 12.1 it is safe to conclude that this latter sequence approaches the
slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. In other words, the instantaneous velocity
v(t) of a body at time t = 2 is equal to the slope of the tangent of the curve s = 4.9t2 at
t = 2.
12.3 Limits
The above discussion clearly points towards the fact that we need to understand limit-
ing process in greater clarity. We study a few illustrative examples to gain some famil-
iarity with the concept of limits.
Consider the function f(x) = x2. Observe that as x takes values very close to 0,
the value of f(x) also moves towards 0 (See Fig 2.10 Chapter 2). We say
( )
0
lim
0
x
f
x
→
=
(to be read as limit of f (x) as x tends to zero equals zero).  The limit of f (x) as x tends
to zero is to be thought of as the value f (x) should assume at x = 0.
In general as x → a, f (x) → l, then l is called limit of the function f (x) which is
symbolically written as 
( )
lim
x
a f
x
l
→
= .
Consider the following function g(x) = |x|, x ≠0. Observe that g(0) is not defined.
Computing the value of g(x) for values of x very
near to 0, we see that the value of g(x) moves
towards 0. So, 
0
lim
x→ g(x) = 0. This is intuitively
clear from the graph of y = |x| for x ≠0.
(See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2).
Consider the following function.
( )

.
Compute the value of h(x) for values  of
x very near to 2 (but not at 2). Convince yourself
that all these values are near to 4. This is
somewhat strengthened by considering the graph
of the function y = h(x) given here (Fig 12.2).
Fig 12.2
Reprint 2025-26
   LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            221
In all these illustrations the value which the function should assume at a given
point x = a did not really depend on how is x tending to a. Note that there are essentially
two ways x could approach a number a  either from left or from right, i.e., all the
values of x near a could be less than a or could be greater than a. This naturally leads
to two limits – the right hand limit and the left hand limit. Right hand limit of a
function f(x) is that value of f(x) which is dictated by the values of f(x) when x tends
to a from the right. Similarly, the left hand limit. To illustrate this, consider the function
( )




Graph of this function is shown in the Fig 12.3. It is
clear that the value of f at 0 dictated by values of f(x) with
x ≤ 0 equals 1, i.e., the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is
0
lim
( ) 1
x
f x
→

Similarly, the value of f at 0 dictated by values of
f (x) with x > 0 equals 2, i.e., the right hand limit of f (x)
at 0 is
0
lim
( )
2
x
f x
+
→
=
.
In this case the right and left hand limits are different, and hence we say that the
limit of f (x) as x tends to zero does not exist (even though the function is defined at 0).
Summary
  We say lim
x
a
→
–  f(x) is the expected value of  f at x = a given the values of f near
x to the left of a. This value is called the left hand limit of f at a.
We say lim
( )
x
a f x
+
→
 is the expected value of f at x = a given the values of
f near x to the right of a. This value is called the right hand limit of f(x) at a.
If the right and left hand limits coincide, we call that common value as the limit
of f(x) at x = a and denote it by lim
x
a
→ f(x).
Illustration 1 Consider the function f(x) = x + 10. We want to find the limit of this
function at x = 5. Let us compute the value of the function f(x) for x very near to 5.
Some   of the points near and to the left of 5 are 4.9, 4.95, 4.99, 4.995. . ., etc. Values
of the function at these points are tabulated below. Similarly, the real number 5.001,
Fig 12.3
Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS
5.01, 5.1 are also points near and to the right of 5. Values of the function at these points
are also given in the Table 12.4.
Table 12.4
From the Table 12.4, we deduce that value of f(x) at x = 5 should be greater than
14.995 and less than 15.001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between x = 4.995
and 5.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 5 as dictated by
the numbers to the left of 5 is 15, i.e.,
( )
–
5
lim

Similarly, when x approaches 5 from the right,  f(x) should be taking value 15, i.e.,
( )

Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are
both equal to 15. Thus,

This conclusion about the limit being equal to 15 is somewhat strengthened by
seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.16, Chapter 2. In this figure, we
note that as x approaches 5 from either right or left, the graph of the function
f(x) = x +10 approaches the point (5, 15).
We observe that the value of the function at x = 5 also happens to be equal to 15.
Illustration 2 Consider the function f(x) = x3. Let us try to find the limit of this
function at x = 1. Proceeding as in the previous case, we tabulate the value of f(x) at
x near 1. This is given in the Table 12.5.

This conclusion about the limit being equal to 1 is somewhat strengthened by
seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.11, Chapter 2. In this figure, we
note that as x approaches 1 from either right or left, the graph of the function
f(x) = x3 approaches the point (1, 1).
We observe, again, that the value of the function at x = 1 also happens to be
equal to 1.
Illustration 3 Consider the function f(x) = 3x. Let us try to find the limit of this
function at x = 2. The following Table 12.6 is now self-explanatory.

at x = 2 coincides with the limit at x = 2.

Graph of f(x) = 3 is anyway the line parallel to x-axis passing through (0, 3) and

note that  in general, at a given point the value of the function and its limit may be
different (even when both are defined).
12.3.1  Algebra of limits In the above illustrations, we have observed that the limiting
process respects addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as long as the limits
and functions under consideration are well defined. This is not a coincidence. In fact,
below we formalise these as a theorem without proof.
Theorem 1 Let f  and g be two functions such that both lim
x
a
→ f (x) and  lim
x
a
→ g(x) exist.
Then
  (i) Limit of sum of two functions is sum of the limits of the functions, i.e.,
lim
x
a
→[f(x) + g (x)] =  lim
x
a
→ f(x) +  lim
x
a
→ g(x).
 (ii)
Limit of difference of two functions is difference of the limits of the functions, i.e.,
lim
x
a
→[f(x) – g(x)] =  lim
x
a
→ f(x) –  lim
x
a
→ g(x).
(iii)
Limit of product of two functions is product of the limits of the functions, i.e.,
lim
x
a
→ [f(x) . g(x)] =  lim
x
a
→ f(x).  lim
x
a
→ g(x).
(iv)
Limit of quotient of two functions is quotient of the limits of the functions (whenever
the denominator is non zero), i.e.,

However, if h(a) = 0, there are two scenarios – (i) when g(a) ≠ 0 and (ii) when
g(a) = 0. In the former case we say that the limit does not exist. In the latter case we
can write g(x) = (x – a)k g1 (x), where k is the maximum of powers of (x – a) in g(x)
Similarly, h(x) = (x – a)l h1 (x) as h (a) = 0. Now, if k > l, we have

12.4 Limits of Trigonometric Functions
The following facts (stated as theorems) about functions in general come in handy in
calculating limits of some trigonometric functions.
Theorem 3 Let f and g be two real valued functions with the same domain such that
f (x) ≤ g( x) for all x in the domain of definition, For some a, if both lim
x
a
→ f(x) and
lim
x
a
→ g(x) exist, then lim
x
a
→ f(x) ≤ lim
x
a
→ g(x). This is illustrated in Fig 12.8.
Theorem 4 (Sandwich Theorem) Let f, g and h be real functions such that
f (x) ≤ g( x) ≤ h(x) for all x in the common domain of definition. For some real number
a, if lim
x
a
→  f(x) = l = lim
x
a
→ h(x), then lim
x
a
→ g(x) = l. This is illustrated in Fig 12.9.
Given below is a beautiful geometric proof of the following important
inequality relating trigonometric functions.

Proof  We know that sin (– x) =  – sin x and cos( – x) = cos x. Hence, it is sufficient
to prove the inequality for 
π

In the Fig 12.10, O is the centre of the unit circle such that
the angle AOC is x radians and 0 < x < π

CD are perpendiculars to OA. Further, join AC. Then
Area of

i.e.,
CD < x . OA < AB.
From ∆OCD,
sin x = CD
OA (since OC = OA) and hence CD = OA sin x. Also  tan x = AB
OA and
hence
AB = OA. tan x. Thus
OA sin x < OA. x < OA. tan x.
Since length OA is positive, we have
sin x < x < tan x.
Since 0 < x < π
2 , sinx is positive and thus by dividing throughout by sin x, we have

Taking reciprocals throughout, we have

function cos x and the constant function which takes value 1.

Say, given that the limit

lim

f x
g x

 exists and we want to evaluate this. First we check
the value of f (a)  and g(a). If both are 0, then we see if we can get the factor which
is causing the terms to vanish, i.e., see if we can write f(x) = f1 (x) f2(x) so that
f1 (a) = 0 and f2 (a) ≠ 0. Similarly, we write g(x) = g1 (x) g2(x), where g1(a) = 0 and
g2(a) ≠ 0. Cancel out the common factors from f(x) and g(x) (if possible) and write

12.5  Derivatives
We have seen in the Section 13.2, that by knowing the position of a body at various
time intervals it is possible to find the rate at which the position of the body is changing.
It is of very general interest to know a certain parameter at various instants of time and
try to finding the rate at which it is changing. There are several real life situations
where such a process needs to be carried out. For instance, people maintaining a
reservoir need to know when will a reservoir overflow knowing the depth of the water
at several instances of time, Rocket Scientists need to compute the precise velocity
with which the satellite needs to be shot out from the rocket knowing the height of the
rocket at various times. Financial institutions need to predict the changes in the value of
a particular stock knowing its present value. In these, and many such cases it is desirable
to know how a particular parameter is changing with respect to some other parameter.
The heart of the matter is derivative of a function at a given point in its domain
of definition.

From the triangle PQR, it is clear that the ratio whose limit we are taking is
precisely equal to tan(QPR) which is the slope of the chord PQ. In the limiting process,

curve y = f(x). Thus the limit turns out to be equal to the slope of the tangent. Hence

For a given function f  we can find the derivative at every point. If the derivative
exists at every point, it defines a new function called the derivative of f . Formally, we
define derivative of a function as follows.

12.5.1 Algebra of derivative of functions  Since the very definition of derivatives
involve limits in a rather direct fashion, we expect the rules for derivatives to follow
closely that of limits. We collect these in the following theorem.

common domain. Then

The proofs of these follow essentially from the analogous theorem for limits. We
will not prove these here. As in the case of limits this theorem tells us how to compute
derivatives of special types of functions. The last two statements in the theorem may
be restated in the following fashion which aids in recalling them easily:
Let 
( )
u

=
 and v = g (x). Then

uv ′  = u v

This is referred to a Leibnitz rule for differentiating product of functions or the
product rule. Similarly, the quotient rule is

Now, let us tackle derivatives of some standard functions.
It is easy to see that the derivative of the function f(x) = x is the constant
function 1. This is because

We use this and the above theorem to compute the derivative of
f(x) = 10x = x + .... + x (ten terms). By (i) of the above theorem
     
( )
df x

We note that this limit may be evaluated using product rule too. Write
f(x) = 10x = uv, where u is the constant function taking value 10 everywhere and
v(x) = x. Here, f(x) = 10x = uv we know that the derivative of u equals 0. Also
derivative of v(x) = x equals 1. Thus by the product rule we have

Remark The above theorem is true for all powers of x, i.e., n can be any real number
(but we will not prove it here).
12.5.2  Derivative of polynomials and trigonometric functions  We start with the
following theorem which tells us the derivative of a polynomial function.

Example 14 Find the derivative of f(x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 +... + x50 at x = 1.
Solution A direct application of the above Theorem 6 tells that the derivative of the
above function is 1 + 2x + 3x2 + . . . + 50x49. At x = 1 the value of this function equals
1 + 2(1) + 3(1)2 + .. . + 50(1)49 = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 50 = (

Solution Clearly this function is defined everywhere except at x = 0. We use the
quotient rule with u = x + 1 and v = x. Hence u′ = 1 and v′ = 1. Therefore

Summary
®The expected value of the function as dictated by the points to the left of a
point defines the left hand limit of the function at that point. Similarly the right
hand limit.
®Limit of a function at a point is the common value of the left and right hand
limits, if they coincide.
®For a function f and a real number a, lim
x
a
→ f(x) and f (a) may not be same (In
fact, one may be defined and not the other one).

Historical Note
In the history of mathematics two names are prominent to share the credit for
inventing calculus, Issac Newton (1642 – 1727) and G.W. Leibnitz (1646 – 1717).
Both of them independently invented calculus around the seventeenth century.
After the advent of calculus many mathematicians contributed for further
development of calculus. The rigorous concept is mainly attributed to the great

MATHEMATICS
mathematicians, A.L. Cauchy, J.L.Lagrange and Karl Weierstrass. Cauchy gave
the foundation of calculus as we have now generally accepted in our textbooks.
Cauchy used D’ Alembert’s limit concept to define the derivative of a function.
Starting with definition of a limit, Cauchy gave examples such as the limit of
sinα
α
 for α = 0. He wrote

 and called the limit for

the “function derive’e, y′ for f ′ (x)”.
Before 1900, it was thought that calculus is quite difficult to teach. So calculus
became beyond the reach of youngsters. But just in 1900, John Perry and others
in England started propagating the view that essential ideas and methods of calculus
were simple and could be taught even in schools. F.L. Griffin, pioneered the
teaching of calculus to first year students. This was regarded as one of the most
daring act in those days.
Today not only the mathematics but many other subjects such as Physics,
Chemistry, Economics and Biological Sciences are enjoying the fruits of calculus.
