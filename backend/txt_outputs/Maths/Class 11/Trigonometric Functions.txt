3.1  Introduction
The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words
‘trigon’ and ‘metron’ and it means ‘measuring the sides of
a triangle’. The subject was originally developed to solve
geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by
sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new
lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is
used in many areas such as the science of seismology,
designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,
predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a
musical tone and in many other areas.
In earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric
ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right
angled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of
trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this
Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions
and study their properties.
3.2  Angles
Angle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is

MATHEMATICS
called the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the
terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of
rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation
is clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).
The measure of an angle is the amount of
rotation performed to get the terminal side from
the initial side. There are several units for
measuring angles. The definition of an angle
suggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as
indicated in Fig 3.2.
This is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly
spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall  describe
two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.
degree measure and radian measure.
3.2.1  Degree measure  If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is 
th

a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as 1°.  A degree is
divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth of a degree is
called a minute, written as 1′, and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as 1″.
Thus,
1° = 60′,
1′ = 60″
Some of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, – 30°, – 420° are
shown in Fig 3.3.

3.2.2  Radian measure  There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called
the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a
unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig
3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the
angles whose measures are 1 radian, –1 radian, 1 1
2  radian and –1 1
2  radian.

(iv)
We know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 2π. Thus, one
complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of  2π radian.
More generally, in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r will subtend an angle of
1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.
Since in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is 1
radian, an arc of length l will subtend an angle whose measure is l
r  radian. Thus, if in
a circle of radius r, an arc of length l subtends an angle θ radian at the centre, we have
θ  = l
r   or  l  = r θ.

MATHEMATICS
3.2.3  Relation between radian and real numbers
Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point
on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.
Then the length  of an arc of the circle will give the radian
measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the
centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is
tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the
real number zero, AP represents positive real number and
AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we
rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the
circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real
number will correspond to a radian measure and
conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can
be considered as one and the same.
3.2.4   Relation between degree and radian   Since a circle subtends at the centre
an angle whose radian measure is 2π and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that
2π radian = 360°
  or
π radian = 180°
The above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree
measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value
of π as 22

1 radian = 180

Notational Convention
Since angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention
that whenever we write angle θ°, we mean the angle whose degree measure is θ and
whenever we write angle β, we mean the angle whose radian measure is β.
Note that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word ‘radian’ is frequently
omitted. Thus, 
π

3.3  Trigonometric Functions
In earlier classes, we have studied trigonometric ratios for acute angles as the ratio of
sides of a right angled triangle. We will now extend the definition of trigonometric
ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.
Consider a unit circle with centre
at origin of the coordinate axes. Let
P (a, b) be any point on the circle with
angle AOP = x radian, i.e., length of arc
AP = x (Fig 3.6).
We define cos x = a and sin x =  b
Since ∆OMP is a right triangle, we have
OM2 + MP2 = OP2 or a2 + b2 = 1
Thus, for every point on the unit circle,
we have
a2 + b2 = 1 or cos2 x + sin2 x = 1
Since one complete revolution
subtends an angle of 2π radian at the
centre of the circle,  ∠AOB = π
2 ,
Fig  3.6
Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS
∠AOC = π and  ∠AOD = 3π
2 . All angles which are integral multiples of π
2  are called
quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively,
(1, 0), (0, 1), (–1, 0) and (0, –1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have
cos 0° = 1
sin 0° = 0,

cosπ = − 1
sinπ = 0
cos 3π
2

sin 3π
2

cos 2π = 1
sin 2π = 0
Now, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to
same point P. Thus, we also observe that if x increases (or decreases) by any integral
multiple of 2π, the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,
sin (2nπ + x)  = sinx, n ∈ Z ,  cos (2nπ + x) = cosx, n ∈ Z
Further, sin x = 0, if x = 0, ± π,  ± 2π , ± 3π, ..., i.e., when x is an integral multiple of π
and cos x = 0, if x = ± π
2 , ± 3π
2  , ± 5π
2 , ... i.e., cos x vanishes when x is an odd
multiple of π

π,

sin x , x ≠  nπ, where n is any integer.

In earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for 0°,
30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same
as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following

3.3.1  Sign of trigonometric functions
Let P (a, b) be a point on the unit circle
with centre at the origin such that
∠AOP = x. If ∠AOQ = – x, then the
coordinates of the point Q will be (a, –b)
(Fig 3.7). Therefore
cos (– x) = cos x
and
sin (– x) = – sin x
Since for every point P (a, b) on
the unit circle, – 1 ≤ a ≤ 1 and

MATHEMATICS
– 1 ≤  b ≤ 1, we have – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1 and –1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 for all x. We   have learnt in
previous classes that in the first quadrant (0 < x < π
2 ) a and b are both positive, in the
second quadrant ( π
2  < x <π) a is negative and b is positive, in the third quadrant
(π < x < 3π
2 ) a and b are both negative and in the fourth quadrant ( 3π
2  < x < 2π) a is
positive and b is negative. Therefore, sin x is positive for 0 < x < π, and negative for
π < x < 2π. Similarly, cos x is positive for 0 < x < π
2 , negative for π
2  <  x < 3π
2  and also
positive for 3π
2 <  x < 2π. Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric

3.3.2  Domain and range of trigonometric functions  From the definition of sine
and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further,
we observe that for each real number x,
 – 1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 and  – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1
Thus, domain of y = sin x and y = cos x is the set of all real numbers and range
is the interval [–1, 1], i.e., – 1 ≤ y ≤ 1.
Reprint 2025-26
 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS     53
Since cosec x = 
1
sin x , the domain of y = cosec x is the set { x : x ∈ R and
x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y  ≥ 1 or y  ≤ – 1}. Similarly, the domain
of y = sec x is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ (2n + 1) π
2 , n ∈ Z} and range is the set
{y : y  ∈ R, y  ≤ – 1or y ≥ 1}. The domain of y = tan x is the set {x : x ∈ R and
x ≠ (2n + 1) π
2 , n ∈ Z} and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of
y = cot x is the set {x : x  ∈ R and x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set of all real
numbers.
We further observe that in the first quadrant, as x increases from 0 to π
2 , sin x
increases from 0 to 1, as x increases from π
2  to π, sin x decreases from 1 to 0. In the
third quadrant, as x increases from π to 3π
2 , sin x decreases from 0 to –1and finally, in
the fourth quadrant, sin x increases from –1 to 0 as x increases from 3π
2  to 2π.
Similarly, we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we
have the following table:
Remark In the above table, the statement tan x increases from 0 to ∞ (infinity) for

2 .  Similarly, to say that
cosec x decreases from –1 to – ∞ (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that
cosec x decreases for x ∈ ( 3π
2 , 2π) and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as
x approaches to 2π. The symbols ∞ and  – ∞ simply specify certain types of behaviour
of functions and variables.
We have already seen that values of sin x and cos x repeats after an interval of
2π. Hence, values of cosec x and sec x will also repeat after an interval of 2π. We

after an interval of π. Since cot x is reciprocal of tan x, its values will also repeat after
an interval of π. Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometic functions, we can
sketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above:

cos (x + y) = cos x cos y – sin x sin y
Consider the unit circle with centre at the origin. Letx be the angle P4OP1and  y be
the angle P1OP2. Then (x + y) is the angle P4OP2. Also let (– y) be the angle P4OP3.
Therefore, P1, P2, P3 and P4 will have the coordinates P1(cos x, sin x),
P2 [cos (x + y), sin (x + y)], P3 [cos (– y), sin (– y)] and P4 (1, 0) (Fig 3.14).
Consider the triangles P1OP3 and P2OP4. They are congruent (Why?). Therefore,
P1P3 and P2P4 are equal. By using distance formula, we get
P1P3

= 2 – 2 (cos x cos y – sin x sin y)

Also,

= [1 – cos (x + y)] 2 + [0 – sin (x + y)]2

Hence  cos (x + y) = cos x cos y – sin x sin y

cos (x – y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y
Replacing y by – y in identity 3, we get

Historical Note
The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and
Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from
India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the
study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian
approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.
In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main
contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of
mathematics.
Bhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for
sines or cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., are given by
Bhaskara II.

The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were
suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:
H
S

 = tan (sun’s altitude)
Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through
the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance
using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.
