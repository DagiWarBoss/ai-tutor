14.1 Event

We have studied about random experiment and sample space associated with an
experiment. The sample space serves as an universal set for all questions concerned
with the experiment.

Consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times. An associated sample space
is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

Now suppose that we are interested in those outcomes which correspond to the
occurrence of exactly one head. We find that HT and TH are the only elements of S
corresponding to the occurrence of this happening (event). These two elements form
the set E = { HT, TH}

We know that the set E is a subset of the sample space S . Similarly, we find the
following correspondence between events and subsets of S.

Description of events Corresponding subset of ‘S’
Number of tails is exactly 2 A= {TT}

Number of tails is atleast one B = {HT, TH, TT}
Number of heads is atmost one C = {HT, TH, TT}

Second toss is not head D= {HT,TT}

Number of tails is atmost two S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
Number of tails is more than two )

The above discussion suggests that a subset of sample space is associated with
an event and an event is associated with a subset of sample space. In the light of this
we define an event as follows.

Definition Any subset E of a sample space S is called an event.

14.1.1 Occurrence of an event Consider the experiment of throwing a die. Let E
denotes the event “a number less than 4 appears”. If actually ‘1’ had appeared on the
die then we say that event E has occurred. As a matter of fact if outcomes are 2 or 3,
we say that event E has occurred

Thus, the event E of a sample space S is said to have occurred if the outcome
w of the experiment is such that @ € E. If the outcome @ is such that wm ¢ E, we say
that the event E has not occurred.

14.1.2 Types of events Events can be classified into various types on the basis of the
elements they have.

1. Impossible and Sure Events The empty set and the sample space S describe
events. In fact is called an impossible event and S, 1.e., the whole sample space is
called the sure event.

To understand these let us consider the experiment of rolling a die. The associated
sample space is

S= {1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6}

Let E be the event “ the number appears on the die is a multiple of 7”. Can you
write the subset associated with the event E?

Clearly no outcome satisfies the condition given in the event, i.e., no element of
the sample space ensures the occurrence of the event E. Thus, we say that the empty
set only correspond to the event E. In other words we can say that it is impossible to
have a multiple of 7 on the upper face of the die. Thus, the event E= 6 is an impossible
event.

Now let us take up another event F “the number turns up is odd or even”. Clearly
F= {1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6,} =S, 1.e., all outcomes of the experiment ensure the occurrence of
the event F. Thus, the event F = S is a sure event.

2. Simple Event If an event E has only one sample point of a sample space, it is
called a simple (or elementary) event.

In a sample space containing 7 distinct elements, there are exactly n simple
events.

For example in the experiment of tossing two coins, a sample space is

S={HH, HT, TH, TT}
There are four simple events corresponding to this sample space. These are
E,= {HH}, E,={HT}, E,= { TH} and E,={TT}.

PROBABILITY 291

3. Compound Event If an event has more than one sample point, it is called a
Compound event.
For example, in the experiment of “tossing a coin thrice” the events
E: ‘Exactly one head appeared’
F: ‘Atleast one head appeared’
G: ‘Atmost one head appeared’ etc.
are all compound events. The subsets of S associated with these events are
E={HTTTHT,TTH}
F={HTT,THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
G= {TTT, THT, HTT, TTH}
Each of the above subsets contain more than one sample point, hence they are all
compound events.

14.1.3. Algebra of events In the Chapter on Sets, we have studied about different
ways of combining two or more sets, viz, union, intersection, difference, complement
of a set etc. Like-wise we can combine two or more events by using the analogous set
notations.

Let A, B, C be events associated with an experiment whose sample space is S.

1. Complementary Event For every event A, there corresponds another event
A' called the complementary event to A. It is also called the event ‘not A’.

For example, take the experiment ‘of tossing three coins’. An associated sample

space is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
Let A={HTH, HHT, THH} be the event ‘only one tail appears’

Clearly for the outcome HTT, the event A has not occurred. But we may say that
the event ‘not A’ has occurred. Thus, with every outcome which is not in A, we say
that ‘not A’ occurs.

Thus the complementary event ‘not A’ to the event A is

A’ = {HHH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
or A’={@:@ € Sand m ¢A}=S-A.

2. The Event ‘A or B’ Recall that union of two sets A and B denoted by A U B
contains all those elements which are either in A or in B or in both.
When the sets A and B are two events associated with a sample space, then
‘A UB’ is the event ‘either A or B or both’. This event ‘A U B’ is also called ‘A or B’.
Therefore Event ‘A orB’=AUB
= {o:a¢€Aora@eB}

Reprint 2025-26

292 MATHEMATICS

3. The Event ‘A and B’ We know that intersection of two sets A 7 B is the set of
those elements which are common to both A and B. i.e., which belong to both
‘A and B’.
If A and B are two events, then the set A ~ B denotes the event ‘A and B’.
Thus, AQ B= {@:@ € Aand @ € B}

For example, in the experiment of ‘throwing a die twice’ Let A be the event
‘score on the first throw is six’ and B is the event ‘sum of two scores is atleast 11’ then

A= {(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}, and B= {(5,6), (6,5), (6,6)}

so AMB= {(6,5), (6,6)}
Note that the set A > B = {(6,5), (6,6)} may represent the event ‘the score on the first
throw is six and the sum of the scores is atleast 11’.

4. The Event ‘A but not B’ We know that A-B is the set of all those elements
which are in A but not in B. Therefore, the set A-B may denote the event ‘A but not
B’.We know that
A-B=ANB’
Example 1 Consider the experiment of rolling a die. Let A be the event ‘getting a
prime number’, B be the event ‘getting an odd number’. Write the sets representing
the events (1) Aor B (ii) A and B (iti) A but not B (av) ‘not A’.
Solution Here S= {1, 2,3, 4,5, 6}, A= {2, 3, 5} and B= {1, 3, 5}
Obviously
(i) ‘AorB’=AU B= {1, 2, 3, 5}

(ii) ‘Aand B’=An B= {3,5}

(ii) ‘A but not B’= A-B= {2}

(iv) ‘not A’=A'= {1,4,6}
14.1.4 Mutually exclusive events In the experiment of rolling a die, a sample space
is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Consider events, A ‘an odd number appears’ and B ‘an even
number appears’

Clearly the event A excludes the event B and vice versa. In other words, there is
no outcome which ensures the occurrence of events A and B simultaneously. Here

A= {1,3, 5} and B= {2, 4, 6}

Clearly A B= 9, i.e., A and B are disjoint sets.

In general, two events A and B are called mutually exclusive events if the

occurrence of any one of them excludes the occurrence of the other event, i.e., if they
can not occur simultaneously. In this case the sets A and B are disjoint.

Reprint 2025-26

PROBABILITY 293

Again in the experiment of rolling a die, consider the events A ‘an odd number
appears’ and event B ‘a number less than 4 appears’

Obviously A= {1,3, 5} and B= {1, 2, 3}

Now 3 € A as wellas3 € B

Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive events.

Remark Simple events of a sample space are always mutually exclusive.

14.1.5 Exhaustive events Consider the experiment of throwing a die. We have
S= {1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6}. Let us define the following events

A: ‘a number less than 4 appears’,
B: ‘a number greater than 2 but less than 5 appears’
and C: ‘a number greater than 4 appears’.

Then A= {1, 2, 3}, B= {3,4} and C = {5, 6}. We observe that
AUBUC= (1, 2,3} U {3,44 U {5, 6} =S.

Such events A, B and C are called exhaustive events. In general, if E,, E,, ..., E, aren
events of a sample space S and if

n

E, VE, VE; V..UE, =VE; =S8

i=l
then E,, E,, ...., E, are called exhaustive events.In other words, events E,, E,, ..., E,
are said to be exhaustive if atleast one of them necessarily occurs whenever the
experiment is performed.

Further, if E, 0 E,= o fori #7 i.e., events E, and E are pairwise disjoint and

n
U E, =S, then events E,, E,, ..., E, are called mutually exclusive and exhaustive

events.
We now consider some examples.

Example 2 Two dice are thrown and the sum of the numbers which come up on the
dice is noted. Let us consider the following events associated with this experiment
A: ‘the sum is even’.
B: ‘the sum is a multiple of 3’.
C: ‘the sum is less than 4’.
D: ‘the sum is greater than 11’.

Which pairs of these events are mutually exclusive?

Solution There are 36 elements in the sample space S = {(x, y): x, y= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Then
A= X(1, 1), C, 3), C1, 5), (2; 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4,4),

C= {(1, 1), 2, 1), C1, 2)} and D = {(6, 6)}
We find that
AQNB= {(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 6)} #0
Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive events.
Similarly AN C#6,AQND46,BAC#¥oandBOD# 9.
Thus, the pairs of events, (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) are not mutually exclusive
events.

Also C ~ D= 6 and so C and D are mutually exclusive events.
Example 3 A coin is tossed three times, consider the following events.

A: ‘No head appears’, B: ‘Exactly one head appears’ and C: ‘Atleast two heads
appear’.
Do they form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events?
Solution The sample space of the experiment is

S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
and A= {TTT}, B= {HTT, THT, TTH}, C = {HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
Now

AUBUC= (TTT, HTT, THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH} = S
Therefore, A,B and C are exhaustive events.
Alsow AQB=9,ANC=9oandBnC=6
Therefore, the events are pair-wise disjoint, i.e., they are mutually exclusive.
Hence, A, B and C form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.

14.2 Axiomatic Approach to Probability

In earlier sections, we have considered random experiments, sample space and
events associated with these experiments. In our day to day life we use many words
about the chances of occurrence of events. Probability theory attempts to quantify
these chances of occurrence or non occurrence of events.

Reprint 2025-26

296 MATHEMATICS

In earlier classes, we have studied some methods of assigning probability to an
event associated with an experiment having known the number of total outcomes.

Axiomatic approach is another way of describing probability of an event. In this
approach some axioms or rules are depicted to assign probabilities.

Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. The probability P is a real
valued function whose domain is the power set of S and range is the interval [0,1]
satisfying the following axioms

(i) ForanyeventE, P(E) >0 (ii) P(S)=1

(ii) If E and F are mutually exclusive events, then P(E U F) = P(E) + P(F).

It follows from (iii) that P() = 0. To prove this, we take F = o and note that E and o
are disjoint events. Therefore, from axiom (ili), we get

P(EU6)=P(E)+P (6) or P(E) = P(E) + P (9) ie. P (b) = 0.

Let S be a sample space containing outcomes @,, @,,...,0, 5 Le.,

S= {@,, ,,..., ,}
It follows from the axiomatic definition of probability that
(i) O<P(@)< 1 for eachw,e S
(ii) P(@,) +P (@,)+..+P(@)=1
(iii) For any event A, P(A) = % P(@,), @, € A.

It may be noted that the singleton {«,} is called elementary event and

for notational convenience, we write P(w,) for P({@, }).

For example, in “a coin tossing’ experiment we can assign the number 3 to each

of the outcomes H and T.
1 1
Le. P(H) = 2 and P(T) = 3

Clearly this assignment satisfies both the conditions i.e., each number is neither
less than zero nor greater than | and

(HY +P(T)= 5 + 5
Therefore, in this case we can say that probability of H= >: and probability of T= >

PROBABILITY 297
Does this assignment satisfy the conditions of axiomatic approach?

1 3
Yes, in this case, probability of H = 4 and probability of T = re

We find that both the assignments (1) and (2) are valid for probability of
H and T.

In fact, we can assign the numbers p and (1 — p) to both the outcomes such that
0<p<land P(H)+ P(T)=p+(1—- p)=1

This assignment, too, satisfies both conditions of the axiomatic approach of
probability. Hence, we can say that there are many ways (rather infinite) to assign
probabilities to outcomes of an experiment. We now consider some examples.

(b) Condition (i): Each of the number p(@,) is either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the assignment is valid
(c) Condition (1) Two of the probabilities p(w.) and p(w,) are negative, the assignment
is not valid

(d) Since p(@,) = 5 > 1, the assignment is not valid

(e) Since, sum of probabilities = 0.1 + 0.2 +0.3+0.4+ 0.5 +0.6 =2.1, the assignment
is not valid.

14.2.1 Probability of an event Let S bea sample space associated with the experiment
‘examining three consecutive pens produced by a machine and classified as Good
(non-defective) and bad (defective)’. We may get 0, 1, 2 or 3 defective pens as result
of this examination.

A sample space associated with this experiment is

S = {BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, GGG},
where B stands for a defective or bad pen and G for a non — defective or good pen.

with ‘tossing of a coin thrice’

and P(B) = P(HTH) + P(THH) + P(HHH) = -

Therefore P(A) + P(B) = 8°88

It is clear that P(A UB) # P(A) + P(B)

The points HTH and THH are common to both A and B. In the computation of
P(A) + P(B) the probabilities of points HTH and THH, i.e., the elements of AB are
included twice. Thus to get the probability P(A U B) we have to subtract the probabilities
of the sample points in AO B from P(A) + P(B)

i.e. P(A UB) = P(A)+ P(B)—- 2X P(@,), Va, eA AB

Thus we observe that, P(A UB) = P(A) + P(B) —P(A AB)

then by the definition of probability of an event, we have

P(AUB)=p(a,), Vo, €4 UB.

Hence P(A UB)=P(A)+P(B) —P(AMB).
Alternatively, it can also be proved as follows:
AUB=AU (B-—A), where A and B — A are mutually exclusive,

and B=(AMB)vU (B-A), where A B and B — A are mutually exclusive.

If A and B are disjoint sets, i.e., they are mutually exclusive events, then AM B= 6

Solution When a card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards, the number of

Example 6 A bag contains 9 discs of which 4 are red, 3 are blue and 2 are yellow. The
discs are similar in shape and size. A disc is drawn at random from the bag. Calculate
the probability that it will be (4) red, (11) yellow, (ii1) blue, (iv) not blue,
(v) either red or blue.
Solution There are 9 discs in all so the total number of possible outcomes is 9.
Let the events A, B, C be defined as
A: ‘the disc drawn is red’
B: ‘the disc drawn is yellow’
C: ‘the disc drawn is blue’.
(i) The number of red discs = 4, 1.e., n (A) =4
Hence P(A) = :

(ii) The number of yellow discs = 2, i.e., n (B) =2

Example 7 Two students Anil and Ashima appeared in an examination. The probability
that Anil will qualify the examination is 0.05 and that Ashima will qualify the examination
is 0.10. The probability that both will qualify the examination is 0.02. Find the
probability that

(a) Both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination.

(b) Atleast one of them will not qualify the examination and
(c) Only one of them will qualify the examination.
Solution Let E and F denote the events that Anil and Ashima will qualify the examination,
respectively. Given that
P(E) = 0.05, P(F) = 0.10 and P(E 1 F) = 0.02.
Then
(a) The event ‘both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination’ may be
expressed as E’ OF’.
Since, E’ is ‘not B’, i.e., Anil will not qualify the examination and F’ is ‘not F’, i.e.,
Ashima will not qualify the examination.
Also E’ AF’ =(E UP)’ (by Demorgan's Law)
Now P(E U F) = P(E) + P(F)— P(E 2 F)

Therefore P(E’ AF’) = P(E UF)’ =1-— P(EU F)=1- 0.13 = 0.87

Example 9 On her vacations Veena visits four cities (A, B, C and D) in a random
order. What is the probability that she visits
(a) A before B? (ii) A before B and B before C?

(v) A just before B?

Solution The number of arrangements (orders) in which Veena can visit four cities A,
B, C, or D is 4! 1.e., 24. Therefore, 1 (S) = 24.

Since the number of elements in the sample space of the experiment is 24 all of these
