Chemical equilibria are important in numerous biological
and environmental processes. For example, equilibria
involving O, molecules and the protein hemoglobin play
a crucial role in the transport and delivery of O, from
our lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO
molecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.

When a liquid evaporates in a closed container,
molecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape
the liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of
liquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid
surface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise
to aconstant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium in
which the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the
number returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that
the system has reached equilibrium state at this stage.
However, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of
activity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour.
Thus, at equilibrium, the rate of evaporation is equal to the
rate of condensation. It may be represented by

H,0O (1) = H,O (vap)

The double half arrows indicate that the processes
in both the directions are going on simultaneously. The
mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state
is called an equilibrium mixture.

Equilibrium can be established for both physical
processes and chemical reactions. The reaction may be
fast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and
the nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed
vessel at a particular temperature react to give products,
the concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing,
while those of products keep on increasing for some time
after which there is no change in the concentrations
of either of the reactants or products. This stage of the
system is the dynamic equilibrium and the rates of the
forward and reverse reactions become equal. It is due to

EQUILIBRIUM

this dynamic equilibrium stage that there is
no change in the concentrations of various
species in the reaction mixture. Based on the
extent to which the reactions proceed to reach
the state of chemical equilibrium, these may
be classified in three groups.

(i) The reactions that proceed nearly
to completion and only negligible
concentrations of the reactants are
left. In some cases, it may not be even
possible to detect these experimentally.

(ii) The reactions in which only small
amounts of products are formed and
most of the reactants remain unchanged
at equilibrium stage.

(iii) The reactions in which the concentrations
of the reactants and products are
comparable, when the system is in
equilibrium.

The extent of a reaction in equilibrium
varies with the experimental conditions such
as concentrations of reactants, temperature,
etc. Optimisation of the operational conditions
is very important in industry and laboratory
so that equilibrium is favorable in the
direction of the desired product. Some
important aspects of equilibrium involving
physical and chemical processes are dealt in
this unit along with the equilibrium involving
ions in aqueous solutions which is called as
ionic equilibrium.

6.1 EQUILIBRIUM IN PHYSICAL
PROCESSES

The characteristics of system at equilibrium
are better understood if we examine some
physical processes. The most familiar examples
are phase transformation processes, e.g.,
solid = __ liquid

liquid = _ gas

solid = _ gas
6.1.1 Solid-Liquid Equilibrium
Ice and water kept in a perfectly insulated
thermos flask (no exchange of heat between its
contents and the surroundings) at 273K and
the atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium
state and the system shows interesting

169

characteristic features. We observe that the
mass of ice and water do not change with
time and the temperature remains constant.
However, the equilibrium is not static.
The intense activity can be noticed at the
boundary between ice and water. Molecules
from the liquid water collide against ice and
adhere to it and some molecules of ice escape
into liquid phase. There is no change of mass
of ice and water, as the rates of transfer of
molecules from ice into water and of reverse
transfer from water into ice are equal at
atmospheric pressure and 273 K.

It is obvious that ice and water are in
equilibrium only at particular temperature
and pressure. For any pure substance at
atmospheric pressure, the temperature at
which the solid and liquid phases are at
equilibrium is called the normal melting point
or normal freezing point of the substance. The
system here is in dynamic equilibrium and we
can infer the following:

(ij) Both the opposing processes occur
simultaneously.

(ii) Both the processes occur at the same
rate so that the amount of ice and water
remains constant.

6.1.2 Liquid-Vapour Equilibrium

This equilibrium can be better understood if
we consider the example of a transparent box
carrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer).
Drying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride
(or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for
a few hours in the box. After removing the
drying agent by tilting the box on one side, a
watch glass (or petri dish) containing water
is quickly placed inside the box. It will be
observed that the mercury level in the right
limb of the manometer slowly increases and
finally attains a constant value, that is, the
pressure inside the box increases and reaches
a constant value. Also the volume of water in
the watch glass decreases (Fig. 6.1). Initially
there was no water vapour (or very less) inside
the box. As water evaporated the pressure in
the box increased due to addition of water
molecules into the gaseous phase inside
the box. The rate of evaporation is constant.

Fig. 6.1 Measuring equilibrium vapour pressure of water at a constant temperature

However, the rate of increase in pressure
decreases with time due to condensation
of vapour into water. Finally it leads to an
equilibrium condition when there is no net
evaporation. This implies that the number
of water molecules from the gaseous state
into the liquid state also increases till the
equilibrium is attained i.e.,
rate of evaporation= rate of condensation
H,O(l) =  H,O (vap)

At equilibrium the pressure exerted by
the water molecules at a given temperature
remains constant and is called the equilibrium
vapour pressure of water (or just vapour
pressure of water); vapour pressure of water
increases with temperature. If the above
experiment is repeated with methyl alcohol,
acetone and ether, it is observed that different
liquids have different equilibrium vapour
pressures at the same temperature, and the
liquid which has a higher vapour pressure is
more volatile and has a lower boiling point.

If we expose three watch glasses containing
separately 1mL each of acetone, ethyl alcohol,
and water to atmosphere and repeat the
experiment with different volumes of the
liquids in a warmer room, it is observed
that in all such cases the liquid eventually
disappears and the time taken for complete
evaporation depends on (i) the nature of the
liquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the
temperature. When the watch glass is open
to the atmosphere, the rate of evaporation
remains constant but the molecules are
dispersed into large volume of the room. As
a consequence the rate of condensation from

vapour to liquid state is much less than the
rate of evaporation. These are open systems
and it is not possible to reach equilibrium in
an open system.

Water and water vapour are in equilibrium
position at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar)
and at 100°C in a closed vessel. The boiling
point of water is 100°C at 1.013 bar pressure.
For any pure liquid at one atmospheric
pressure (1.013 bar), the temperature
at which the liquid and vapours are at
equilibrium is called normal boiling point of
the liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends
on the atmospheric pressure. It depends on
the altitude of the place; at high altitude the
boiling point decreases.

6.1.3 Solid - Vapour Equilibrium

Let us now consider the systems where solids
sublime to vapour phase. If we place solid
iodine in a closed vessel, after sometime
the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour
and the intensity of colour increases with
time. After certain time the intensity of
colour becomes constant and at this stage
equilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine
sublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine
vapour condenses to give solid iodine. The
equilibrium can be represented as,

I,(solid) =I, (vapour)

Other examples showing this kind of
equilibrium are,

Camphor (solid) = Camphor (vapour)
NH, Cl (solid) = NH,Cl (vapour)

6.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution
of Solid or Gases in Liquids

Solids in liquids

We know from our experience that we can
dissolve only a limited amount of salt or
sugar in a given amount of water at room
temperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup
solution by dissolving sugar at a higher
temperature, sugar crystals separate out if we
cool the syrup to the room temperature. We call
it a saturated solution when no more of solute
can be dissolved in it at a given temperature.
The concentration of the solute in a saturated
solution depends upon the temperature. In
a saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium
exits between the solute molecules in the solid
state and in the solution:

Sugar (solution) = Sugar (solid), and

the rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of
crystallisation of sugar.

Equality of the two rates and dynamic
nature of equilibrium has been confirmed with
the help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some
radioactive sugar into saturated solution of
non-radioactive sugar, then after some time
radioactivity is observed both in the solution
and in the solid sugar. Initially there were no
radioactive sugar molecules in the solution
but due to dynamic nature of equilibrium,
there is exchange between the radioactive
and non-radioactive sugar molecules between
the two phases. The ratio of the radioactive
to non-radioactive molecules in the solution
increases till it attains a constant value.

Gases in liquids

When a soda water bottle is opened, some of
the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes
out rapidly. The phenomenon arises due
to difference in solubility of carbon dioxide
at different pressures. There is equilibrium
between the molecules in the gaseous state
and the molecules dissolved in the liquid
under pressure i.e.,

CO, (gas) = CO, (in solution)

This equilibrium is governed by Henry’s
law, which states that the mass of a gas
dissolved in a given mass of a solvent at
any temperature is proportional to the

171

pressure of the gas above the solvent.
This amount decreases with increase of
temperature. The soda water bottle is sealed
under pressure of gas when its solubility in
water is high. As soon as the bottle is opened,
some of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas
escapes to reach a new equilibrium condition
required for the lower pressure, namely its
partial pressure in the atmosphere. This is
how the soda water in bottle when left open
to the air for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be
generalised that:
(i) For solid = liquid equilibrium, there is
only one temperature (melting point) at
1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two
phases can coexist. If there is no
exchange of heat with the surroundings,
the mass of the two phases remains
constant.
(ii) For liquid — vapour equilibrium, the
vapour pressure is constant at a given
temperature.

(iii) For dissolution of solids in liquids,
the solubility is constant at a given
temperature.

(iv) For dissolution of gases in liquids,
the concentration of a gas in liquid
is proportional to the pressure
(concentration) of the gas over the liquid.
These observations are summarised in
Table 6.1

6.1.5 General Characteristics of
Equilibria Involving Physical
Processes

For the physical processes discussed above,

following characteristics are common to the

system at equilibrium:

(i) | Equilibrium is possible only in a closed

system at a given temperature.

(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at

the same rate and there is a dynamic
but stable condition.

(iii) All measurable properties of the system
remain constant.

(iv) When equilibrium is attained for a
physical process, it is characterised by
constant value of one of its parameters
at a given temperature. Table 6.1 lists
such quantities.

(v) The magnitude of such quantities at any
stage indicates the extent to which the
physical process has proceeded before
reaching equilibrium.

6.2 EQUILIBRIUM IN CHEMICAL
PROCESSES - DYNAMIC
EQUILIBRIUM

Analogous to the physical systems chemical
reactions also attain a state of equilibrium.
These reactions can occur both in forward
and backward directions. When the rates of
the forward and reverse reactions become
equal, the concentrations of the reactants
and the products remain constant. This
is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This
equilibrium is dynamicin nature as it consists
of a forward reaction in which the reactants
give product(s) and reverse reaction in which
product(s) gives the original reactants.

For a better comprehension, let us consider
a general case of a reversible reaction,

A+B=C+D

With passage of time, there is
accumulation of the products C and D and
depletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 6.2).
This leads to a decrease in the rate of
forward reaction and an increase in the rate
of the reverse reaction,

CHEMISTRY

Time —>

Fig. 6.2 Attainment of chemical equilibrium.

Eventually, the two reactions occur at the
same rate and the system reaches a state of
equilibrium.

Similarly, the reaction can reach the state
of equilibrium even if we start with only C and
D; that is, no A and B being present initially,
as the equilibrium can be reached from either
direction.

The dynamic nature of chemical
equilibrium can be demonstrated in the
synthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process.
In a series of experiments, Haber started
with known amounts of dinitrogen and
dihydrogen maintained at high temperature
and pressure and at regular intervals
determined the amount of ammonia present.
He was successful in determining also the
concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and
dinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after
a certain time the composition of the mixture
remains the same even though some of the
reactants are still present. This constancy in
composition indicates that the reaction has
reached equilibrium. In order to understand
the dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis
of ammonia is carried out with exactly the
same starting conditions (of partial pressure
and temperature) but using D, (deuterium)
in place of H,. The reaction mixtures starting
either with H, or D, reach equilibrium with
the same composition, except that D, and
ND, are present instead of H, and NH,. After

Dynamic Equilibrium — A Student’s Activity

Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can
be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory.
However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity
can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.

Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of
30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill
nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal
of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty.

Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1,
close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to
cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2" cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner
from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass
tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both
the cylinders becomes constant.

If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be
any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of
coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say
the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic
nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find
that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are
responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product
in it at the beginning.

equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures
(H,, N,, NH, and D,, N,, ND.) are mixed
together and left for a while. Later, when
this mixture is analysed, it is found that the
concentration of ammonia is just the same
as before. However, when this mixture is
analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found
that ammonia and all deuterium containing
forms of ammonia (NH,, NH,D, NHD, and
ND,) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms
(H,, HD and D,) are present. Thus one can
conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in
the molecules must result from a continuation
of the forward and reverse reactions in the
mixture. If the reaction had simply stopped
when they reached equilibrium, then there
would have been no mixing of isotopes in
this way.

Use of isotope (deuterium) in the formation
of ammonia clearly indicates that chemical
reactions reach a state of dynamic
equilibrium in which the rates of forward
and reverse reactions are equal and there
is no net change in composition.

Equilibrium can be attained from both
sides, whether we start reaction by taking,
H,(g) and N,(g) and get NH,(g) or by taking
NH,(g) and decomposing it into N,(g) and H,(g).

N,(g) + 3H,(g) — 2NH,(g)

CHEMISTRY

2NH,(g) = N,(g) + 3H,(g)

Similarly let us consider the reaction,
H,(g) + L(g) = 2HI(g). If we start with
equal initial concentration of H, and I,, the
reaction proceeds in the forward direction
and the concentration of H, and I, decreases
while that of HI increases, until all of these
become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We
can also start with HI alone and make the
reaction to proceed in the reverse direction;
the concentration of HI will decrease and
concentration of H, and I, will increase until
they all become constant when equilibrium is
reached (Fig. 6.5). If total number of H and I
atoms are same in a given volume, the same
equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we
start it from pure reactants or pure product.

LAW OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM
AND EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT

A mixture of reactants and products in the
equilibrium state is called an equilibrium
mixture. In this section we shall address a
number of important questions about the
composition of equilibrium mixtures: What is
the relationship between the concentrations
of reactants and products in an equilibrium
mixture? How can we determine equilibrium
concentrations from initial concentrations?
What factors can be exploited to alter the

composition of an equilibrium mixture? The
last question in particular is important when
choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial
chemicals such as H,, NH,, CaO etc.

To answer these questions, let us consider
a general reversible reaction:

A+BWC+D

where A and B are the reactants, C and D
are the products in the balanced chemical
equation. On the basis of experimental studies
of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian
chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and
Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the
concentrations in an equilibrium mixture
are related by the following equilibrium
equation,

~ _ ell

* [AI[B]
(6.1) where K, is the equilibrium constant and
the expression on the right side is called the
equilibrium constant expression.

The equilibrium equation is also known as
the law of mass action because in the early
days of chemistry, concentration was called
“active mass”. In order to appreciate their
work better, let us consider reaction between

gaseous H, and I, carried out in a sealed vessel
at 731K.

H.,(g)

Six sets of experiments with varying initial
conditions were performed, starting with only
gaseous H, and I, in a sealed reaction vessel
in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and
only HI in other two experiments (5 and 6).
Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed
taking different concentrations of H, and / or
I,, and with time it was observed that intensity
of the purple colour remained constant and
equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for
experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was
attained from the opposite direction.

Data obtained from all six sets of
experiments are given in Table 6.2.

It is evident from the experiments 1, 2,
3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen
reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted
= % (number of moles of HI formed). Also,
experiments 5 and 6 indicate that,

[H,(8)].4 = LalSleg

Knowing the above facts, in order
to establish a relationship between
concentrations of the reactants and products,
several combinations can be tried. Let us
consider the simple expression,

[HI(e)]., / [Hleg Halle.

It can be seen from Table 6.3 that if we
put the equilibrium concentrations of the
reactants and products, the above expression

is far from constant. However, if we consider
the expression,

[HI(g)]?., / [y(@)leg [a(2)eg

we find that this expression gives constant
value (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six
cases. It can be seen that in this expression
the power of the concentration for reactants
and products are actually the stoichiometric
coefficients in the equation for the chemical
reaction. Thus, for the reaction H,(g) + I,(g) =
2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium
constant K, is written as,

K, = (HU @)12/ (H(2leg Ha(leg (6.2)

Generally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for
equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration
terms. It is taken for granted that the
concentrations in the expression for K, are
equilibrium values. We, therefore, write,

K, = [HI(g)]? / [H,(g)] (L(2)] (6.3)

The subscript ‘c’ indicates that K, is
expressed in concentrations of mol L?.

At a given temperature, the product of
concentrations of the reaction products
raised to the respective stoichiometric
coefficient in the balanced chemical
equation divided by the product of
concentrations of the reactants raised to
their individual stoichiometric coefficients
has a constant value. This is known as
the Equilibrium Law or Law of Chemical
Equilibrium.

CHEMISTRY

The equilibrium constant for a general
reaction,

aA +bBwecCt+dD

is expressed as,

K, = [C}[D]* / [A}*[B]P (6.4)

where [A], [B], [C] and [D] are the equilibrium
concentrations of the reactants and products.

Equilibrium constant for the reaction,
4NH,(g) + 50,(g) = 4NO(g) + 6H,O(g) is written
as

K, = [NO}*[H,O]° / [NH,]* [O,]°

Molar concentration of different species is
indicated by enclosing these in square bracket
and, as mentioned above, it is implied that
these are equilibrium concentrations. While
writing expression for equilibrium constant,
symbol for phases (s, |, g) are generally ignored.

Let us write equilibrium constant for the
reaction, H,(g) + L(g) = 2HI(g) (6.5)

as, K.= [HI]? / [H,] [L] =x (6.6)

The equilibrium constant for the reverse
reaction, 2HI(g) = H,(g) + L(g), at the same
temperature is,

K i= [H,] [L,] / [HI]? =1/x=1/ K, (6.7)
Thus, K,=1/ K, (6.8)
Equilibrium constant for the reverse

reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium

constant for the reaction in the forward
direction.

If we change the stoichiometric coefficients
in a chemical equation by multiplying
throughout by a factor then we must make
sure that the expression for equilibrium
constant also reflects that change. For
example, if the reaction (6.5) is written as,

2 H,(g) + % L(g) = Hl(g) (6.9)
the equilibrium constant for the above
reaction is given by

Ky = [HI] / [H,]'/7(L)'? = (All? / [H,J[,}°/°

= x'/? = K 1/2? (6,10)
On multiplying the equation (6.5) by n, we get

nH,(g) + nI,(g) D = 2nHI(g) (6.11)

Therefore, equilibrium constant for the
reaction is equal to K,”. These findings are
summarised in Table 6.4. It should be noted
that because the equilibrium constants K,
and K, have different numerical values, it is
important to specify the form of the balanced
chemical equation when quoting the value of
an equilibrium constant.

Problem 6.1

The following concentrations were
obtained for the formation of NH, from
N, and H, at equilibrium at SOOK.
[N,] = 1.5 x 10°M. [H,] = 3.0 x10?M and
[NH,] = 1.2 x10°M. Calculate equilibrium
constant.

Solution

The equilibrium constant for the reaction,

6.4 HOMOGENEOUS EQUILIBRIA

In a homogeneous system, all the reactants
and products are in the same phase.
For example, in the gaseous reaction,
N,(g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH,(g), reactants and
products are in the homogeneous phase.
Similarly, for the reactions,
CH,COOC,H, (aq) + H,O (1) = CH,COOH (aq)
+ C,H.OH (aq)
and, Fe** (aq) + SCN-(aq) = Fe(SCN)?* (aq)
all the reactants and products are in
homogeneous solution phase. We shall now
consider equilibrium constant for some
homogeneous reactions.

6.4.1 Equilibrium Constant in Gaseous
Systems

So far we have expressed equilibrium
constant of the reactions in terms of molar
concentration of the reactants and products,
and used symbol, K, for it. For reactions
involving gases, however, it is usually more
convenient to express the equilibrium
constant in terms of partial pressure.

The ideal gas equation is written as,
pV=nRT

Therefore,
n/ Vis concentration expressed in mol/m?
If concentration c, is in mol/L or mol/ dm‘,
and p is in bar then
p= cRT,
We can also write p = [gas]RT.
Here, R= 0.0831 bar litre/mol K
At constant temperature, the pressure of
the gas is proportional to its concentration i.e.,
p ~ [gas]
For reaction in equilibrium
H(g) + L(g) = 2HI(g)
We can write either

[H1(g)]

or kK, = (6.12)
(Pu, )(P.,)
Further, since p,, =[HI(g)|RT

equilibrium constants are equal. However,
this is not always the case. For example in

Calculate equilibrium concentrations of CO,,

Let x mole per litre of each of the product

Hence, equilibrium constant can be written
as,

x? = 4.24(0.01 + x?-0.2x)

x? = 0.0424 + 4.24x?-0.848x

the value 0.194 should be neglected because

6.5 HETEROGENEOUS EQUILIBRIA

Equilibrium in a system having more than one
phase is called heterogeneous equilibrium.
The equilibrium between water vapour and
liquid water in a closed container is an
example of heterogeneous equilibrium.

H,,O(1) = H,O(g)
In this example, there is a gas phase and

a liquid phase. In the same way, equilibrium
between a solid and its saturated solution,

Ca(OH), (s) + (aq) = Ca?* (aq) + 20H (aq)
is a heterogeneous equilibrium.

Heterogeneous equilibria often involve
pure solids or liquids. We can simplify
equilibrium expressions for the heterogeneous
equilibria involving a pure liquid or a pure
solid, as the molar concentration of a pure
solid or liquid is constant (i.e., independent
of the amount present). In other words if a
substance ‘X’ is involved, then [X(s)] and [X(L)]
are constant, whatever the amount of ‘X’ is
taken. Contrary to this, [X(g)] and [X(aq)] will

Reprint 2025-26

180

vary as the amount of X in a given volume
varies. Let us take thermal dissociation of
calcium carbonate which is an interesting and
important example of heterogeneous chemical
equilibrium.

CaCO, (s) A. CaO (s) + CO, (g)

ee

(6.16)

On the basis of the stoichiometric equation,
we can write,

_ [Ca0(s)][ CO, (g)]
° | Caco, (s) |
Since [CaCO,(s)] and [CaO(s)] are both
constant, therefore modified equilibrium

constant for the thermal decomposition of
calcium carbonate will be

kK’, = [CO,(g)]
or K, = Poo,

(6.17)
(6.18)

Units of Equilibrium Constant

The value of equilibrium constant K, can be
calculated by substituting the concentration
terms in mol/L and for K, partial pressure
is substituted in Pa, kPa, bar or atm. This
results in units of equilibrium constant based
on molarity or pressure, unless the exponents
of both the numerator and denominator are
same.

For the reactions,

H,(g) + L(g) = 2HI, kK, and K, have no
unit.

N,O,(g) = 2NO, (g), K, has unit mol/L
and K, has unit bar

Equilibrium constants can also be
expressed as dimensionless quantities if the
standard state of reactants and products
are specified. For a pure gas, the standard
state is lbar. Therefore a pressure of 4 bar
in standard state can be expressed as 4
bar/1 bar = 4, which is a dimensionless
number. Standard state (c,) for a solute is 1
molar solution and all concentrations can be
measured with respect to it. The numerical
value of equilibrium constant depends on the
standard state chosen. Thus, in this system
both K, and K, are dimensionless quantities
but have different numerical values due to
different standard states.

CHEMISTRY

This shows that at a particular
temperature, there is a constant concentration
or pressure of CO, in equilibrium with CaO(s)
and CaCO,(s). Experimentally it has been
found that at 1100 K, the pressure of CO,
in equilibrium with CaCO,(s) and CaO(s), is
2.0 x10° Pa. Therefore, equilibrium constant
at 1100K for the above reaction is:

K, = Poo, = 2 X 10° Pa/ 10° Pa = 2.00
Similarly, in the equilibrium between

nickel, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl
(used in the purification of nickel),

Ni (s) + 4 CO (g) = Ni(CO), (g),
the equilibrium constant is written as
[Ni(CO), |

It must be remembered that for the
existence of heterogeneous equilibrium pure
solids or liquids must also be present (however
small the amount may be) at equilibrium, but
their concentrations or partial pressures do
not appear in the expression of the equilibrium
constant. In the reaction,

EQUILIBRIUM

6.6 APPLICATIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM
CONSTANTS

Before considering the applications of

equilibrium constants, let us summarise the

important features of equilibrium constants
as follows:

1. Expression for equilibrium constant is
applicable only when concentrations of
the reactants and products have attained
constant value at equilibrium state.

2. The value of equilibrium constant is
independent of initial concentrations of
the reactants and products.

3. Equilibrium constant is temperature
dependent having one unique value for
a particular reaction represented by a
balanced equation at a given temperature.

4. The equilibrium constant for the reverse
reaction is equal to the inverse of the
equilibrium constant for the forward
reaction.

181

5. The equilibrium constant K for a reaction
is related to the equilibrium constant
of the corresponding reaction, whose
equation is obtained by multiplying or
dividing the equation for the original
reaction by a small integer.

Let us consider applications of equilibrium
constant to:

e predict the extent of a reaction on the
basis of its magnitude,

e predict the direction of the reaction, and
e calculate equilibrium concentrations.

6.6.1 Predicting the Extent ofa
Reaction

The numerical value of the equilibrium
constant for a reaction indicates the extent
of the reaction. But it is important to note
that an equilibrium constant does not give
any information about the rate at which
the equilibrium is reached. The magnitude
of K, or K, is directly proportional to the
concentrations of products (as these appear
in the numerator of equilibrium constant
expression) and inversely proportional to the
concentrations of the reactants (these appear
in the denominator). This implies that a high
value of Kis suggestive of a high concentration
of products and vice-versa.

We can make the following generalisations
concerning the composition of equilibrium
mixtures:

e If K, > 10°, products predominate over
reactants, i.e., if K, is very large, the
reaction proceeds nearly to completion.
Consider the following examples:

(a) The reaction of H, with O, at 500 K
has a very large equilibrium constant,
K, = 2.4 x 10%”.

(b) H,(g) + Cl,(g) == 2HCl(g) at 300K has
K,= 4.0 x 10°.

(c) H,(g) + Br,(g) = 2HBr (g) at 300 K,
K,= 5.4 x 10'®

e If K,< 10°, reactants predominate over
products, i.e., if K, is very small, the
reaction proceeds rarely. Consider the
following examples:

Reprint 2025-26

182

(a) The decomposition of H,O into H, and
O, at 500 K has a very small equilibrium
constant, K,= 4.1 x 10°*°

N,(g) + O,(g) = 2NO(g),

at 298 K has K, = 4.8 x10°°.

e If K,is in the range of 10° to 10%,
appreciable concentrations of both
reactants and products are present.
Consider the following examples:

(b

For reaction of H, with I, to give HI,
K,= 57.0 at 700K.

Also, gas phase decomposition of N,O,
to NO, is another reaction with a value
of K, = 4.64 x 10° at 25°C which is
neither too small nor too large. Hence,
equilibrium mixtures contain appreciable
concentrations of both N,O, and NO,.

These generarlisations are illustrated in

6.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the
Reaction

The equilibrium constant helps in predicting
the direction in which a given reaction will
proceed at any stage. For this purpose,
we calculate the reaction quotient Q.
The reaction quotient, Q (Q. with molar
concentrations and Q, with partial pressures)
is defined in the same way as the equilibrium
constant K, except that the concentrations
in Q are not necessarily equilibrium values.
For a general reaction:
aA+bB =—cC+dD
= [C][D]* / [A}*[B]°

Then,

If QO. > K,, the reaction will proceed in the
direction of reactants (reverse reaction).

(6.19)
(6.20)

If QO, < K,, the reaction will proceed in the
direction of the products (forward reaction).

CHEMISTRY

If 0. = K,, the reaction mixture is already
at equilibrium.

Consider the gaseous reaction of H,
with L,,

H,(g) + L(g) = 2HI(g); K, = 57.0 at 700 K.

Suppose we have molar concentrations
[H,],=0.10M, [I,], = 0.20 M and [HI], = 0.40 M.
(the subscript t on the concentration symbols
means that the concentrations were measured
at some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at
equilibrium).

Thus, the reaction quotient, Q, at this

stage of the reaction is given by,
= [HI]? / [H,], [L,], = (0-40)?/ (0.10)x(0.20)
= 8.0

Now, in this case, Q. (8.0) does not equal
K,(57.0), so the mixture of H,(g), I,(g) and HI(g)
is not at equilibrium; that is, more H,(g) and
I,(g) will react to form more HI(g) and their
concentrations will decrease till Q, = K,.

The reaction quotient, Q, is useful in
predicting the direction of reaction by
comparing the values of Q. and K..

Thus, we can make the following
generalisations concerning the direction of
the reaction (Fig. 6.7) :

Q, = (3 x10~4)(3 x 10°) / (3 x10)? = 1

as Q.> K,so the reaction will proceed in the
reverse direction.

6.6.3 Calculating Equilibrium
Concentrations

In case of a problem in which we know the
initial concentrations but do not know any of
the equilibrium concentrations, the following

three steps shall be followed:

Step 1. Write the balanced equation for the

reaction.

Step 2. Under the balanced equation, make
a table that lists for each substance involved

in the reaction:

(a) the initial concentration,

(b) the change in concentration on going to

equilibrium, and
(c) the equilibrium concentration.

In constructing the table, define x as the
concentration (mol/L) of one of the substances
that reacts on going to equilibrium, then use
the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine
the concentrations of the other substances in

terms of x.

Step 3. Substitute the equilibrium
concentrations into the equilibrium equation
for the reaction and solve for x. If you are
to solve a quadratic equation choose the
mathematical solution that makes chemical

sense.

Step 4. Calculate the equilibrium
concentrations from the calculated value of x.
Step 5. Check your results by substituting

them into the equilibrium equation.

6.7 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT K,
REACTION QUOTIENT Q AND
GIBBS ENERGY G

The value of K, for a reaction does not depend
on the rate of the reaction. However, as you
have studied in Unit 5, it is directly related
to the thermodynamics of the reaction and
in particular, to the change in Gibbs energy,
AG. If,

e AG is negative, then the reaction is
spontaneous and proceeds in the forward
direction.

e AGis positive, then reaction is considered
non-spontaneous. Instead, as reverse
reaction would have a negative AG, the
products of the forward reaction shall be
converted to the reactants.

e AGis O, reaction has achieved equilibrium;
at this point, there is no longer any free
energy left to drive the reaction.

A mathematical expression of this
thermodynamic view of equilibrium can be
described by the following equation:

AG =AG*°+RT1InQ
where, G®° is standard Gibbs energy.

At equilibrium, when AG = 0 and Q= K,,
the equation (6.21) becomes,

AG = AG? +RTIn K=0

AG? =—-RTInk

Ink =-—AG® / RT

(6.21)

(6.22)

CHEMISTRY

Taking antilog of both sides, we get,
K = @Aco/k? (6.23)
Hence, using the equation (6.23), the
reaction spontaneity can be interpreted in
terms of the value of AG®.

e If AG° < 0, then -AG°/RT is positive,
and e-ADG®°/RT>1, making K >1, which
implies a spontaneous reaction or the
reaction which proceeds in the forward
direction to such an extent that the
products are present predominantly.

e IfAG®* > 0, then -AG°/RT is negative, and
e-AG®°</RT 1, thatis , K< 1, which implies
a non-spontaneous reaction or a reaction
which proceeds in the forward direction
to such a small degree that only a very
minute quantity of product is formed.

6.8 FACTORS AFFECTING EQUILIBRIA

One of the principal goals of chemical
synthesis is to maximise the conversion of the

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 6.indd 185

EQUILIBRIUM

reactants to products while minimising the
expenditure of energy. This implies maximum
yield of products at mild temperature and
pressure conditions. If it does not happen,
then the experimental conditions need to be
adjusted. For example, in the Haber process
for the synthesis of ammonia from N, and
H,, the choice of experimental conditions is
of real economic importance. Annual world
production of ammonia is about hundred
million tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.

Equilibrium constant, K, is independent
of initial concentrations. But if a system at
equilibrium is subjected to a change in the
concentration of one or more of the reacting
substances, then the system is no longer at
equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in
some direction until the system returns to
equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change
in temperature or pressure of the system may
also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide
what course the reaction adopts and make
a qualitative prediction about the effect of a
change in conditions on equilibrium we use
Le Chatelier’s principle. It states that a
change in any of the factors that determine
the equilibrium conditions of a system
will cause the system to change in sucha
manner so as to reduce or to counteract
the effect of the change. This is applicable
to all physical and chemical equilibria.

We shall now be discussing factors which
can influence the equilibrium.

6.8.1 Effect of Concentration Change

In general, when equilibrium is disturbed
by the addition/removal of any reactant/
products, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts
that:

e The concentration stress of an added
reactant/product is relieved by net
reaction in the direction that consumes
the added substance.

e The concentration stress of a removed
reactant/product is relieved by net
reaction in the direction that replenishes
the removed substance.
or in other words,

185

“When the concentration of any of the
reactants or products in a reaction at
equilibrium is changed, the composition
of the equilibrium mixture changes so as
to minimize the effect of concentration
changes”.

Let us take the reaction,
H,(g) + L(g) = 2HI(g)

If H, is added to the reaction mixture
at equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the
reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it,
the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein
H, is consumed, i.e., more of H, and I, react
to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts
in right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in
accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle
which implies that in case of addition of a
reactant/product, a new equilibrium will
be set up in which the concentration of the
reactant/product should be less than what it
was after the addition but more than what it
was in the original mixture.

Addition of hydrogen at equilibrium
results in value of Q, being less than K,. Thus,
in order to attain equilibrium again reaction
moves in the forward direction. Similarly,
we can say that removal of a product also
boosts the forward reaction and increases
the concentration of the products and this
has great commercial application in cases
of reactions, where the product is a gas ora
volatile substance. In case of manufacture of
ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed
from the reaction mixture so that reaction
keeps moving in forward direction. Similarly,
in the large scale production of CaO (used
as important building material) from CaCO,,
constant removal of CO, from the kiln drives
the reaction to completion. It should be
remembered that continuous removal of a
product maintains Q at a value less than K,
and reaction continues to move in the forward
direction.

Effect of Concentration —- An experiment

This can be demonstrated by the following
reaction:

Fe**(aq)+ SCN-(aq) = [Fe(SCN)]?*(aq) (6.24)
yellow colourless deep red
| Fe(SCN)" (aq) |
[ Fe (aq) ]| SCN’ (aq) (6.25)

A reddish colour appears on adding two
drops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution
to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(II) nitrate solution due
to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]?*. The intensity
of the red colour becomes constant on
attaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be
shifted in either forward or reverse directions
depending on our choice of adding a reactant
or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted
in the opposite direction by adding reagents
that remove Fe** or SCN ions. For example,
oxalic acid (H,C,O,), reacts with Fe** ions
to form the stable complex ion [Fe(C,O,),]*,
thus decreasing the concentration of free
Fe**(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier’s
principle, the concentration stress of removed
Fe* is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]|?*
to replenish the Fe** ions. Because the

CHEMISTRY

concentration of [Fe(SCN)]?* decreases, the
intensity of red colour decreases.

Addition of aq. HgCl, also decreases red
colour because Hg” reacts with SCN™ ions to
form stable complex ion [Hg(SCN),]?. Removal
of free SCN (aq) shifts the equilibrium
in equation (6.24) from right to left to
replenish SCN ions. Addition of potassium
thiocyanate on the other hand increases the
colour intensity of the solution as it shift the
equilibrium to right.

6.8.2 Effect of Pressure Change

A pressure change obtained by changing the
volume can affect the yield of products in
case of a gaseous reaction where the total
number of moles of gaseous reactants and
total number of moles of gaseous products are
different. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle
to a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect
of pressure changes on solids and liquids
can be ignored because the volume (and
concentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly
independent of pressure.

Consider the reaction,
CO(g) + 3H,(g) = CH,(g) + H,O(g)

Here, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H,)
become 2 mol of gaseous products (CH, +
H,O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above
reaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston
at constant temperature is compressed to
one half of its original volume. Then, total
pressure will be doubled (according to
pV = constant). The partial pressure and
therefore, concentration of reactants and
products have changed and the mixture is no
longer at equilibrium. The direction in which
the reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium
can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s
principle. Since pressure has doubled,
the equilibrium now shifts in the forward
direction, a direction in which the number
of moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we
know pressure is proportional to moles of the
gas). This can also be understood by using
reaction quotient, Q. Let [CO], [H,], [CH,]
and [H,O] be the molar concentrations at
equilibrium for methanation reaction. When
volume of the reaction mixture is halved, the

Reprint 2025-26

EQUILIBRIUM

partial pressure and the concentration are
doubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by
replacing each equilibrium concentration by
double its value.

_ [er (g) [#0 (@)]
[co(g) |[H. (gs)

As Q.< K,, the reaction proceeds in the

Cc

forward direction.

In reaction C(s) + CO,(g) = 2CO(g), when
pressure is increased, the reaction goes in the
reverse direction because the number of moles
of gas increases in the forward direction.

Q.

6.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas Addition

If the volume is kept constant and an inert gas
such as argon is added which does not take
part in the reaction, the equilibrium remains
undisturbed. It is because the addition of
an inert gas at constant volume does not
change the partial pressures or the molar
concentrations of the substance involved in
the reaction. The reaction quotient changes
only if the added gas is a reactant or product
involved in the reaction.

6.8.4 Effect of Temperature Change

Whenever an equilibrium is disturbed by
a change in the concentration, pressure or
volume, the composition of the equilibrium
mixture changes because the reaction
quotient, Q.no longer equals the equilibrium
constant, K,. However, when a change in
temperature occurs, the value of equilibrium
constant, K, is changed.

In general, the temperature dependence
of the equilibrium constant depends on the
sign of AH for the reaction.

e =6The equilibrium constant for an exothermic
reaction (negative AH) decreases as the
temperature increases.

e The equilibrium constant for an
endothermic reaction (positive AH)
increases as the temperature increases.

Temperature changes affect the
equilibrium constant and rates of reactions.

187

Production of ammonia according to the
reaction,

N,(g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH,(g);
AH= — 92.38 kJ mol!

is an exothermic process. According to
Le Chatelier’s principle, raising the
temperature shifts the equilibrium to left
and decreases the equilibrium concentration
of ammonia. In other words, low temperature
is favourable for high yield of ammonia, but
practically very low temperatures slow down
the reaction and thus a catalyst is used.

Effect of Temperature — An experiment

Effect of temperature on equilibrium can
be demonstrated by taking NO, gas (brown
in colour) which dimerises into N,O, gas
(colourless).

2NO,(g) = N,O,(g); AH = -57.2 kJ mol

NO, gas prepared by addition of Cu
turnings to conc. HNO, is collected in two
5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity
of colour of gas in each tube) and stopper
sealed with araldite. Three 250 mL beakers
1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water
at room temperature and hot water (363K),
respectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test
tubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes.
After this one is placed in beaker 1 and the
other in beaker 3. The effect of temperature
on direction of reaction is depicted very well
in this experiment. At low temperatures in
beaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of
N,O, is preferred, as reaction is exothermic,
and thus, intensity of brown colour due
to NO, decreases. While in beaker 3, high
temperature favours the reverse reaction of

formation of NO, and thus, the brown colour
intensifies.

Effect of temperature can also be seen in
an endothermic reaction,

At room temperature, the equilibrium
mixture is blue due to [CoCl1,]*. When cooled
in a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture
turns pink due to [Co(H,O),]**.

6.8.5 Effect of a Catalyst

A catalyst increases the rate of the chemical
reaction by making available a new low energy
pathway for the conversion of reactants to
products. It increases the rate of forward
and reverse reactions that pass through the
same transition state and does not affect
equilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation
energy for the forward and reverse reactions
by exactly the same amount. Catalyst does
not affect the equilibrium composition of
a reaction mixture. It does not appear in
the balanced chemical equation or in the
equilibrium constant expression.

Let us consider the formation of NH,
from dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is
highly exothermic reaction and proceeds
with decrease in total number of moles
formed as compared to the reactants.
Equilibrium constant decreases with increase
in temperature. At low temperature rate
decreases and it takes long time to reach at
equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give
satisfactory rates but poor yields.

German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered
that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse
the reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate
at temperatures, where the equilibrium
concentration of NH, is reasonably favourable.
Since the number of moles formed in the
reaction is less than those of reactants, the
yield of NH, can be improved by increasing
the pressure.

Optimum conditions of temperature
and pressure for the synthesis of NH, using
catalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.

CHEMISTRY

Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric
acid by contact process,

2S0,(g) + O,(g) = 2S0,(g); K,= 1.7 x 107°
though the value of Kis suggestive of reaction
going to completion, but practically the
oxidation of SO, to SO, is very slow. Thus,
platinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V,O.)
is used as catalyst to increase the rate of the
reaction.

Note: If a reaction has an exceedingly small
K, a catalyst would be of little help.

6.9 IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTION

Under the effect of change of concentration
on the direction of equilibrium, you have
incidently come across with the following
equilibrium which involves ions:

Fe**(aq) + SCN-(aq) = [Fe(SCN)]?*(aq)

There are numerous equilibria that involve
ions only. In the following sections we will
study the equilibria involving ions. It is well
known that the aqueous solution of sugar
does not conduct electricity. However, when
common salt (sodium chloride) is added
to water it conducts electricity. Also, the
conductance of electricity increases with an
increase in concentration of common salt.
Michael Faraday classified the substances
into two categories based on their ability
to conduct electricity. One category of
substances conduct electricity in their
aqueous solutions and are called electrolytes
while the other do not and are thus, referred to
as non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified
electrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes.
Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water
are ionized almost completely, while the weak
electrolytes are only partially dissociated.
For example, an aqueous solution of
sodium chloride is comprised entirely of
sodium ions and chloride ions, while that
of acetic acid mainly contains unionized
acetic acid molecules and only some acetate
ions and hydronium ions. This is because
there is almost 100% ionization in case
of sodium chloride as compared to less
than 5% ionization of acetic acid which is
a weak electrolyte. It should be noted

Reprint 2025-26

11/2/2022 4:11:28 PM

Unit 6.indd 189

EQUILIBRIUM

that in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is
established between ions and the unionized
molecules. This type of equilibrium involving
ions in aqueous solution is called ionic
equilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come
under the category of electrolytes and may act
as either strong or weak electrolytes.

6.10 ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS

Acids, bases and salts find widespread
occurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid
present in the gastric juice is secreted by the
lining of our stomach in a significant amount
of 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive
processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main
constituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange
juices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and
tartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As
most of the acids taste sour, the word “acid”
has been derived from a latin word “acidus”
meaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue
litmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen
on reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases
are known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste
bitter and feel soapy. A common example
of a base is washing soda used for washing
purposes. When acids and bases are mixed
in the right proportion they react with each
other to give salts. Some commonly known
examples of salts are sodium chloride, barium
sulphate, sodium nitrate. Sodium chloride
(common salt) is an important component of
our diet and is formed by reaction between
hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It

189

exists in solid state as a cluster of positively
charged sodium ions and negatively charged
chloride ions which are held together due to
electrostatic interactions between oppositely
charged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic
forces between two charges are inversely
proportional to dielectric constant of the
medium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses
a very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus,
when sodium chloride is dissolved in water,
the electrostatic interactions are reduced by
a factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to
move freely in the solution. Also, they are
well-separated due to hydration with water
molecules.

Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of
14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the
books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant
to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent. During
this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the
leading scientists of the time. In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal
Institution laboratories, and in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of
Chemistry. Faraday’s first important work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821

much of his work was on electricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic

phenomena. His ideas have led to the establishment of modern field theory.

He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest and kind hearted
person. He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to work alone and
never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his Friday evening
discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution. He has been very famous for his Christmas
lecture on the ‘Chemical History of a Candle’. He published nearly 450 scientific papers.

molecules, former is completely ionized into
its constituent ions, while the latter is only
partially ionized (< 5%). The extent to which
ionization occurs depends upon the strength
of the bond and the extent of solvation
of ions produced. The terms dissociation
and ionization have earlier been used with
different meaning. Dissociation refers to the
process of separation of ions in water already
existing as such in the solid state of the solute,
as in sodium chloride. On the other hand,
ionization corresponds to a process in which
aneutral molecule splits into charged ions in
the solution. Here, we shall not distinguish
between the two and use the two terms
interchangeably.

6.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and
Bases

According to Arrhenius theory, acids are
substances that dissociates in water to
give hydrogen ions H*(aq) and bases are
substances that produce hydroxyl ions
OH (aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can
be represented by the following equations:
HX (aq) — H*(aq) + X (aq)
or
HX(aq) + H,O(l) — H,O*(aq) + X (aq)

A bare proton, H* is very reactive and
cannot exist freely in aqueous solutions.
Thus, it bonds to the oxygen atom ofa solvent
water molecule to give trigonal pyramidal
hydronium ion, H,O* {[H (H,O)]*} (see box). In
this chapter we shall use H*(aq) and H,O*(aq)
interchangeably to mean the same i.e., a
hydrated proton.

Similarly, a base molecule like MOH
ionizes in aqueous solution according to the
equation:

MOH(aq) > M*(aq) + OH (aq)

The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated
form in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius
concept of acid and base, however, suffers
from the limitation of being applicable only to
aqueous solutions and also, does not account
for the basicity of substances like, ammonia
which do not possess a hydroxyl group.

CHEMISTRY

Hydronium and Hydroxyl Ions

Hydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very
small size (~10-'° m radius) and intense electric
field, binds itself with the water molecule at
one of the two available lone pairs on it giving
H,O*. This species has been detected in many
compounds (e.g., H,O*CI) in the solid state. In
aqueous solution the hydronium ion is further
hydrated to give species like H,O;, H,O,* and
H,O;. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated
to give several ionic species like H,O;, H,O,
and H,O, etc.

6.10.2 The Brénsted-Lowry Acids and
Bases

The Danish chemist, Johannes Bronsted and
the English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave
a more general definition of acids and bases.
According to Brénsted-Lowry theory, acid
is a substance that is capable of donating a
hydrogen ion H* and bases are substances
capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H*. In
short, acids are proton donors and bases are
proton acceptors.

Consider the example of dissolution of NH,

Svante Arrhenius

Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the
conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884. For the
next five years he travelled extensively and visited a number of research centers
in Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed
University of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902. From 1905 until his
death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. He
continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions. In 1899 he discussed

the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now
usually known as Arrhenius equation.

He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to
immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was
the first to discuss the ‘green house effect’ calling by that name. He received Nobel
Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in

the development of chemistry.

base, respectively. In the reverse reaction,
H* is transferred from NH; to OH. In this
case, NH; acts as a Bronsted acid while
OH acted as a Brénsted base. The acid-base
pair that differs only by one proton is called
a conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH™
is called the conjugate base of an acid H,O
and NH} is called conjugate acid of the base
NH,. If Brénsted acid is a strong acid then
its conjugate base is a weak base and vice-
versa. It may be noted that conjugate acid
has one extra proton and each conjugate base
has one less proton.

Consider the example of ionization of
hydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as
an acid by donating a proton to H,O molecule
which acts as a base.

It can be seen in the above equation, that
water acts as a base because it accepts the
proton. The species H,O* is produced when
water accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore,
Cl is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the
conjugate acid of base Cl. Similarly, H,O is
a conjugate base of an acid H,O* and H,O* is
a conjugate acid of base H,O.

It is interesting to observe the dual role
of water as an acid and a base. In case of
reaction with HCl water acts as a base while

in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by
donating a proton.

6.10.3 Lewis Acids and Bases

G.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid asa
species which accepts electron pair and base
which donates an electron pair. As far as bases
are concerned, there is not much difference
between Brénsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts,
as the base provides a lone pair in both the
cases. However, in Lewis concept many
acids do not have proton. A typical example
is reaction of electron deficient species BF,
with NH,.

BF, does not have a proton but still acts
as an acid and reacts with NH, by accepting
its lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be
represented by,

BF, + :NH, > BF,:NH,

Electron deficient species like AICl,, Co*,
Mg?*, etc. can act as Lewis acids while species
like H,O, NH,, OH etc. which can donate a
pair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.

acids and Lewis bases and show how these

(a) Hydroxylion is a Lewis base as it can

(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base

electron lone pairs.

accept a lone pair of electrons from
bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride
ion.

(d) BCl, acts as a Lewis acid as it can
accept a lone pair of electrons from
species like ammonia or amine
molecules.

6.11 IONIZATION OF ACIDS AND BASES

Arrhenius concept of acids and bases
becomes useful in case of ionization of acids
and bases as mostly ionizations in chemical
and biological systems occur in aqueous
medium. Strong acids like perchloric acid

CHEMISTRY

(HC1O,), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic
acid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid
(HNO.,) and sulphuric acid (H,SO,) are termed
strong because they are almost completely
dissociated into their constituent ions in an
aqueous medium, thereby acting as proton
(H*) donors. Similarly, strong bases like
lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium
hydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide
Ba(OH), are almost completely dissociated
into ions in an aqueous medium giving
hydroxyl ions, OH. According to Arrhenius
concept they are strong acids and bases as
they are able to completely dissociate and
produce H,O* and OH ions respectively in
the medium. Alternatively, the strength of an
acid or base may also be gauged in terms of
Brénsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases,
wherein a strong acid means a good proton
donor and a strong base implies a good proton
acceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation
equilibrium of a weak acid HA,
HA(aq) + H,O(l) = H,O*(aq) + A(aq)
conjugate conjugate
acid base acid base
In section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or
base) dissociation equilibrium is dynamic
involving a transfer of proton in forward and
reverse directions. Now, the question arises
that if the equilibrium is dynamic then with
passage of time which direction is favoured?
What is the driving force behind it? In order
to answer these questions we shall deal
into the issue of comparing the strengths
of the two acids (or bases) involved in the
dissociation equilibrium. Consider the two
acids HA and H,O* present in the above
mentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium.
We have to see which amongst them is a
stronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds
in its tendency of donating a proton over the
other shall be termed as the stronger acid
and the equilibrium will shift in the direction
of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid
than H,O*, then HA will donate protons and
not H,O’," and the solution will mainly contain
A and H,O* ions. The equilibrium moves in
the direction of formation of weaker acid

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 6.indd 193

EQUILIBRIUM

and weaker base because the stronger acid
donates a proton to the stronger base.

It follows that as a strong acid dissociates
completely in water, the resulting base formed
would be very weak i.e., strong acids have
very weak conjugate bases. Strong acids
like perchloric acid (HC1O,), hydrochloric acid
(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid
(HI), nitric acid (HNO,) and sulphuric acid
(H,SO,) will give conjugate base ions ClO;, Cl,
Br, , NO; and HSO;, which are much weaker
bases than H,O. Similarly a very strong base
would give a very weak conjugate acid. On the
other hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially
dissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the
solution mainly contains undissociated HA
molecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous
acid (HNO,), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic
acid (CH,COOH). It should be noted that the
weak acids have very strong conjugate bases.
For example, NH,, O* and H~ are very good
proton acceptors and thus, much stronger
bases than H,O.

Certain water soluble organic compounds
like phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue
behave as weak acids and exhibit different
colours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base
(In-) forms.

HIn(aq) + H,O(l) = H,O*(aqg) + In(aq)

Such compounds are useful as indicators

6.11.1 The Ionization Constant of Water
and its Ionic Product

Some substances like water are unique in
their ability of acting both as an acid anda
base. We have seen this in case of water in
section 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it
accepts a proton and acts as the base while
in the presence of a base, Bit acts as an
acid by donating a proton. In pure water, one
H,O molecule donates proton and acts as an
acid and another water molecules accepts a
proton and acts as a base at the same time.
The following equilibrium exists:

193

H,O(l) + H,O(l) = H,O*(aq) + OH (aq)
acid base conjugate conjugate
acid base
The dissociation constant is represented by,
K = [H,O*] [OH] / [H,O] (6.26)
The concentration of water is omitted from
the denominator as water is a pure liquid and
its concentration remains constant. [H,O] is
incorporated within the equilibrium constant
to give a new constant, K,, which is called the
ionic product of water.
K,, = [H*][OH] (6.27)
The concentration of H* has been found
out experimentally as 1.0 x 107M at 298 K.
And, as dissociation of water produces equal
number of H* and OH ions, the concentration
of hydroxyl ions, [OH] = [H*] = 1.0 x 10’ M.
Thus, the value of K, at 298K,
K,, = [H,O*][OH] = (1 = 10°’)? = 1 x 10°'* M?
(6.28)

The value of K, is temperature dependent
as it is an equilibrium constant.

The density of pure water is 1000 g / L
and its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this
the molarity of pure water can be given as,
[H,O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M.
Therefore, the ratio of dissociated water to
that of undissociated water can be given as:
107 / (55.55) = 1.8 x 10% or ~ 2in 10° (thus,
equilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated
water)

We can distinguish acidic, neutral and
basic aqueous solutions by the relative values
of the H,O* and OH concentrations:

Acidic: [H,O*] > [OH]

Neutral: [H,O*] = [OH]

Basic : [H,O*] < [OH]

6.11.2 The pH Scale

Hydronium ion concentration in molarity is
more conveniently expressed on a logarithmic
scale known as the pH scale. The pH ofa
solution is defined as the negative logarithm

to base 10 of the activity (a,,.) of hydrogen

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 6.indd 194

194

ion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity
of hydrogen ion (H*) is equal in magnitude
to molarity represented by [H’*]. It should
be noted that activity has no units and is
defined as:

a. =[H*] / mol L*

From the definition of pH, the following
can be written,

pH = - log a,,, = — log {[H*] / mol L“}

Thus, an acidic solution of HCl (10? M)
will have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution
of NaOH having [OH] =10% M and [H,O*] =
10°°° M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure
water has a concentration of hydrogen ions,
[H*] = 10°’ M. Hence, the pH of pure water is
given as:

pH = -log(10~’) = 7

Acidic solutions possess a concentration
of hydrogen ions, [H*] > 10’ M, while basic
solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen
ions, [H*] < 10’ M. thus, we can summarise
that
Acidic solution has pH < 7
Basic solution has pH > 7
Neutral solution has pH = 7

Now again, consider the equation (6.28)
at 298 K
= [H,O*] [OH] = 10°“
Taking negative logarithm on both sides
of equation, we obtain
-log K,= - log {H,0°] [OH}
= — log [H,O*] — log [OH]
=-—log 10°%
pk, = pH + pOH = 14 (6.29)
Note that although K, may change
with temperature the variations in pH with
temperature are so small that we often
ignore it.

pk, is a very important quantity for
aqueous solutions and controls the relative
concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl
ions as their product is a constant. It should
be noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic,
a change in pH by just one unit also means
change in [H*] by a factor of 10. Similarly,

CHEMISTRY

when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H"*|
changes by a factor of 100, the value of pH
changes by 2 units. Now you can realise why
the change in pH with temperature is often
ignored.

Measurement of pH of a solution is very
essential as its value should be known
when dealing with biological and cosmetic
applications. The pH of a solution can be
found roughly with the help of pH paper that
has different colour in solutions of different
pH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with
four strips on it. The different strips have
different colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH.
The pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined
with an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper.

For greater accuracy pH meters are used.
pH meter is a device that measures the
pH-dependent electrical potential of the test
solution within 0.001 precision. pH meters
of the size of a writing pen are now available
in the market. The pH of some very common
substances are given in Table 6.5 (page 195).

Problem 6.16
The concentration of hydrogen ion in a
sample of soft drink is 3.8 x 10°M. what
is its pH ?
Solution
pH = - log[3.8 x 10°]

= — flog[3.8] + log[10~]}

= — {(0.58) + (— 3.0)} =- {- 2.42} = 2.42
Therefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42
and it can be inferred that it is acidic.

Let, x = [OH] = [H,O*] from H,O. The
H,O* concentration is generated (i) from
the ionization of HCI dissolved i.e.,

HCl(aq) + H,O(l) = H,O* (aq) + Cl -(aq),
and (ii) from ionization of H,O. In these very

dilute solutions, both sources of H,O* must
be considered:

[H,O*] = 10° +x

K,,= (10° + x)(x) = 10°"

So, pOH = 7.02 and pH = 6.98

6.11.3 Ionization Constants of Weak Acids

Consider a weak acid HX that is partially
ionized in the aqueous solution. The
equilibrium can be expressed by:

Here, c = initial concentration of the
undissociated acid, HX at time, t = 0. a =
extent up to which HX is ionized into ions.
Using these notations, we can derive the

equilibrium constant for the above discussed
acid-dissociation equilibrium:
K, = 70? / c(1-a) = ca? / 1-0

K, is called the dissociation or ionization
constant of acid HX. It can be represented
alternatively in terms of molar concentration
as follows,

K, = [H*|2<] / [HX] (6.30)

At a given temperature T, K, is a
measure of the strength of the acid HX i.e.,
larger the value of K,, the stronger is the
acid. K, is a dimensionless quantity with
the understanding that the standard state
concentration of all species is 1M.

The values of the ionization constants
of some selected weak acids are given in
Table 6.6.

The pH scale for the hydrogen ion
concentration has been so useful that besides
pK,, it has been extended to other species and

quantities. Thus, we have:
pk, = —log (K,) (6.31)

Knowing the ionization constant, K,
of an acid and its initial concentration, c,
it is possible to calculate the equilibrium
concentration of all species and also the
degree of ionization of the acid and the pH of
the solution.

A general step-wise approach can be
adopted to evaluate the pH of the weak
electrolyte as follows:

Step 1. The species present before
dissociation are identified as Brénsted-Lowry
acids/bases.

Step 2. Balanced equations for all possible
reactions i.e., with a species acting both as
acid as well as base are written.

Step 3. The reaction with the higher K, is
identified as the primary reaction whilst the
other is a subsidiary reaction.

Step 4. Enlist in a tabular form the following
values for each of the species in the primary
reaction

(a) Initial concentration, c.

(b) Change in concentration on proceeding
to equilibrium in terms of a, degree of
ionization.

(c) Equilibrium concentration.

Step 5. Substitute equilibrium concentrations
into equilibrium constant equation for
principal reaction and solve for a.

Step 6. Calculate the concentration of species
in principal reaction.

Step 7. Calculate pH = — log/H,O*]

The above mentioned methodology has
been elucidated in the following examples.

Problem 6.18

The ionization constant of HF is
3.2 x 10%. Calculate the degree of
dissociation of HF in its 0.02 M solution.
Calculate the concentration of all species

The following proton transfer reactions are
possible:

1) HF + HO = H,O* + F

2) H,O + H,O = H,O* + OH”

Substituting equilibrium concentrations
in the equilibrium reaction for principal
reaction gives:

K, = (0.02a)? / (0.02 — 0.02q)

= 0.02 a / (1 -a) = 3.2 x 107%

We obtain the following quadratic equation:
o? + 1.6 x 10°%a- 1.6 x 107 =0

The quadratic equation in a can be solved
and the two values of the roots are:

a=+0.12 and-0.12

The negative root is not acceptable and
hence,

a=0.12

This means that the degree of ionization,

a = 0.12, then equilibrium concentrations

of other species viz., HF, F ~~ and H,O* are

given by:

[H,O*] = [F ] = ca = 0.02 x 0.12
=2.4x10°M

[HF] = c(1 - a) = 0.02 (1 — 0.12)

=17.6x10°M

pH = - log[H*] = -log(2.4 x 10°) = 2.62

and HA at equilibrium. Also, determine the
value of K, and pK, of the monobasic acid.

Solution
pH = - log [H’]
Therefore, [H*] = 10 -# = 104°
= 3.16 x 10°

[H*] = [A] = 3.16 x 10°

Thus, K, = [H*][A] / [HA]

[HA] nm = 0-1 — (3.16 x 10°) = 0.1

K, = (3.16 x 10°)? / 0.1 = 1.0 x 10%

6.11.4 Ionization of Weak Bases

The ionization of base MOH can be represented
by equation:

MOH(aq) = M*(aq) + OH-(aq)

In a weak base there is partial ionization
of MOH into M* and OH,, the case is similar
to that of acid-dissociation equilibrium. The
equilibrium constant for base ionization
is called base ionization constant and is
represented by K,. It can be expressed in
terms of concentration in molarity of various
species in equilibrium by the following
equation:

K, = [M*][OH] / [MOH] (6.33)

Alternatively, if c = initial concentration
of base and o = degree of ionization of base
i.e. the extent to which the base ionizes.
When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium
constant can be written as:

K, = (ca)? / c (1-a) = co? / (1-a)

The values of the ionization constants of
some selected weak bases, K, are given in
Table 6.7.

example, methylamine, codeine, quinine and

nicotine all behave as very weak bases due to
their very small K,. Ammonia produces OH in

aqueous solution:

NH,(aq) + H,O(l) = NH;(aq) + OH (aq)

The pH scale for the hydrogen ion

concentration has been extended to get:

pk, = —log (K,)

Problem 6.21

(6.34)

The pH of 0.004M hydrazine solution is 9.7.
Calculate its ionization constant K, and pK,.

Solution

NH,NH, + H,O NH,NH, + OH

From the pH we can calculate the hydrogen
ion concentration. Knowing hydrogen ion
concentration and the ionic product of
water we can calculate the concentration

of hydroxyl ions. Thus we have:

[H*] = antilog (—pH)
= antilog (-9.7) = 1.67 x10"'°

[OH] = K, / [H*] = 1 x 10° / 1.67 x 107°

= 5.98 x 10°

The concentration of the corresponding
hydrazinium ion is also the same as that
of hydroxyl ion. The concentration of both
these ions is very small so the concentration
of the undissociated base can be taken

equal to 0.004M.
Thus,
K, = [NH,NH,"][OH] / [NH,NH,]

= (5.98 x 10°)? / 0.004 = 8.96 x 10”

As K, is small, we can neglect x in comparison
to 0.1M and 0.2M. Thus,

[OH] = x = 0.88 x 10°

Therefore, [H*] = 1.12 x 10°

pH = -— log[H*] = 8.95.

6.11.5 Relation between K, and K,
As seen earlier in this chapter, K, and kK,
represent the strength of an acid and a base,
respectively. In case of a conjugate acid-base
pair, they are related in a simple manner so
that if one is known, the other can be deduced.
Considering the example of NH; and NH,
We See,
NH;(aq) + H,O(l) = H,O*(aq) + NH,(aq)

K, = [H,O*]| NH,] / [NH,*] = 5.6 x 1077°

NH,(aq) + H,O(l) = NH,*(aq) + OH(aq)

K, =| NH,"]| OH] / NH, = 1.8 x 10°

Net: 2 H,O(l) = H,O*(aq) + OH~(aq)

K,, = [H,O*]| OH] = 1.0 x 107*M

Where, K, represents the strength of NH;
as an acid and K, represents the strength of
NH, as a base.

It can be seen from the net reaction that
the equilibrium constant is equal to the
product of equilibrium constants K, and Kk,
for the reactions added. Thus,

K, * K, = {[H,0°][ NH,] / [NH; ]} = t[NH,"]
[OH] / [NH,]}
= [H,O*][OH] = K,
= (5.6 x1071°) x (1.8 x 10°) =1.0 x 10"%M

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 6.indd 199

EQUILIBRIUM

This can be extended to make a
generalisation. The equilibrium constant
for a net reaction obtained after adding
two (or more) reactions equals the product
of the equilibrium constants for individual
reactions:

Kypp = K, X Ky oe (6.35)

Similarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base
pair,

K,x K,=K, (6.36)

Knowing one, the other can be obtained.
It should be noted that a strong acid will have
a weak conjugate base and vice-versa.

Alternatively, the above expression
K, = K, x K,, can also be obtained by
considering the base-dissociation equilibrium
reaction:

B(aq) + H,O(l) = BH*(aq) + OH (aq)

K, = [BH*][OH] / [B]

As the concentration of water remains
constant it has been omitted from the
denominator and incorporated within the
dissociation constant. Then multiplying and
dividing the above expression by |[H’], we get:

K, = [BH"][OH ][H"] / [B][H"]

={| OH[H}([BH*] / [B][H*}

or K,x Kk, = Kk,

It may be noted that if we take negative
logarithm of both sides of the equation, then
pK values of the conjugate acid and base are
related to each other by the equation:

pk, + pK, = pK, = 14 (at 298K)

Problem 6.23

Determine the degree of ionization and pH of
a 0.05M of ammonia solution. The ionization
constant of ammonia can be taken from
Table 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization
constant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.

Solution

The ionization of NH, in water is represented
by equation:

199

NH, + HO = NH; + OH
We use equation (6.33) to calculate
hydroxyl ion concentration,
[OH] =ca=0.05 a
K, = 0.05 a? / (1 —@)
The value of a is small, therefore the
quadratic equation can be simplified by
neglecting @ in comparison to 1 in the
denominator on right hand side of the
equation,
Thus,
K,=co? or a=V(1.77 x 10° / 0.05)

= 0.018.
[OH] =ca=0.05 x 0.018 = 9.4 x 10°M.
[H*] = K, / [OH] = 10°* / (9.4 x 10%)

= 1.06 x 107!
pH = -log(1.06 x 107!) = 10.97.
Now, using the relation for conjugate
acid-base pair,
K, x K,=K,
using the value of K, of NH, from
Table 6.7.
We can determine the concentration of
conjugate acid NH;
K,=K,/ K,= 10 / 1.77 x 10°

= 5.64 x 107°.

6.11.6 Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di-
and Polyacidic Bases

Some of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric
acid and phosphoric acids have more than
one ionizable proton per molecule of the
acid. Such acids are known as polybasic or
polyprotic acids.

The ionization reactions for example for
a dibasic acid H,X are represented by the
equations:

H,X(aq) = H*(aq) + HX-(aq)

HX-(aq) = H*(aq) + X?(aq)

And the corresponding equilibrium
constants are given below:

K, = {{H")[HX]}} / [H,X] and

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 6.indd 200

200

K,, = {A}? ]} / [AX]

Here, K, and K, are called the first and second
ionization constants respectively of the acid H,
X. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H,PO, we
have three ionization constants. The values
of the ionization constants for some common
polyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.

Table 6.8 The Ionization Constants of Some
Common Polyprotic Acids (298K)

Oxalic Acid
Ascorbic Acid
Sulphurous Acid

Sulphuric Acid
Carbonic Acid
Citric Acid
Phosphoric Acid

It can be seen that higher order ionization
constants (K, K,) are smaller than the

lower order ionization constant (K,) of a
polyprotic acid. The reason for this is that
it is more difficult to remove a positively
charged proton from a negative ion due to
electrostatic forces. This can be seen in the
case of removing a proton from the uncharged
H,CO, as compared from a negatively charged
HCO. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove
a proton from a doubly charged HPO? anion
as compared to H,PO,.

Polyprotic acid solutions contain a
mixture of acids like H,A, HA and A” in case
of a diprotic acid. H,A being a strong acid, the
primary reaction involves the dissociation of
H, A, and H,O* in the solution comes mainly
from the first dissociation step.

6.11.7 Factors Affecting Acid Strength

Having discussed quantitatively the strengths
of acids and bases, we come to a stage where
we can calculate the pH of a given acid
solution. But, the curiosity rises about why
should some acids be stronger than others?
What factors are responsible for making
them stronger? The answer lies in its being a
complex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking
we can say that the extent of dissociation of
an acid depends on the strength and polarity
of the H-A bond.

CHEMISTRY

In general, when strength of H-A bond
decreases, that is, the energy required to break
the bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger
acid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more
polar i.e., the electronegativity difference
between the atoms H and A increases and
there is marked charge separation, cleavage
of the bond becomes easier thereby increasing
the acidity.

But it should be noted that while comparing
elements in the same group of the periodic
table, H-A bond strength is a more important
factor in determining acidity than its polar
nature. As the size of A increases down the
group, H-A bond strength decreases and so
the acid strength increases. For example,

Size increases

HF << HCl << HBr << HI

Acid strength increases
Similarly, H,S is stronger acid than H,O.

But, when we discuss elements in the same
row of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity
becomes the deciding factor for determining
the acid strength. As the electronegativity
of A increases, the strength of the acid also
increases. For example,

Electronegativity of A increases
CH, < NH, < H,O < HF
Acid strength increases
6.11.8 Common Ion Effect in the
Ionization of Acids and Bases
Consider an example of acetic acid dissociation
equilibrium represented as:

CH,COOH(aq) = H*(aq) + CH,COO: (aq)

or HAc(aq) = H* (aq) + Ac (aq)

K, = [H*][Ac’] / [HAc]

Addition of acetate ions to an acetic
acid solution results in decreasing the
concentration of hydrogen ions, [H*]. Also,
if H* ions are added from an external source
then the equilibrium moves in the direction
of undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction

of reducing the concentration of hydrogen
ions, [H*]. This phenomenon is an example

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 6.indd 201

EQUILIBRIUM

of common ion effect. It can be defined as
a shift in equilibrium on adding a substance
that provides more of an ionic species already
present in the dissociation equilibrium.
Thus, we can say that common ion effect is
a phenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s
principle discussed in section 6.8.

In order to evaluate the pH of the solution
resulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to
0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider
the acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once
again,

HAc(aq) = H*(aq) + Ac-(aq)

Initial concentration (M)

0.05 O 0.05

Let x be the extent of ionization of acetic
acid.

Change in concentration (M)
-x +X +X

Equilibrium concentration (M)

0.05-x x 0.05+x

Therefore,
K,= [H*][Ac ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)
As K, is small for a very weak acid, x<<0.05.
Hence, (0.05 + x) = (0.05 — x) = 0.05
Thus,
1.8 x 10° = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 — x)
= x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H*] = 1.8 x 10°M
pH = - log(1.8 x 10°) = 4.74

Problem 6.24

Calculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia
solution. Calculate the pH after 50.0 mL
of this solution is treated with 25.0 mL of
0.10M HCl. The dissociation constant of
ammonia, K, = 1.77 x 10°

Solution

NH, + H,O — NH, +
K, = [NH,*][OH] / [NH,] = 1.77 x 10°
Before neutralization,
[NH,"] = [OH] = x
[NH,] = 0.10-x =0.10
x? / 0.10 = 1.77 x 10°

Thus, x = 1.33 x 10° = [OH]
Therefore, [H*] = K, / [OH] = 10% /

(1.33 x 10°) = 7.51 x 10°?
pH = -log (7.5 x 10%) = 11.12

On addition of 25 mL of 0.1M HCl
solution (i.e., 2.5 mmol of HCl) to 50
mL of 0.1M ammonia solution (i.e., 5
mmol of NH,), 2.5 mmol of ammonia
molecules are neutralized. The resulting
75 mL solution contains the remaining
unneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH, molecules
and 2.5 mmol of NH7.

The resulting 75 mL of solution contains

2.5 mmol (i.e., 0.033 M) of uneutralised
NH, molecules. This NH, exists in the
following equilibrium:

NH,OH = NH; + OH
0.033M — y y y
where, y = [OH] = [NHj]

The final 75 mL solution after
neutralisation already contains
2.5 m mol NH; ions (i.e. 0.033M), thus
total concentration of NH,* ions is given
as:

[NH] = 0.033 + y
As y is small, [NH,OH] = 0.033 M and
[NH,*] = 0.033M.

We know,
K, = [NH,"][OH] / [NH,OH]

= y (0.033) /(0.033) = 1.77 x 10° M
Thus, y = 1.77 x 10° = [OH]
[H*] = 10° / 1.77 x 10° = 0.56 x 10°
Hence, pH = 9.24

with water to reform corresponding acids/
bases depending upon the nature of salts.
The later process of interaction between
water and cations/anions or both of salts
is called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution
gets affected by this interaction. The cations
(e.g., Nat, K*, Ca?*, Ba?*, etc.) of strong bases
and anions (e.g., Cl, Br, NO;, ClO, etc.) of
strong acids simply get hydrated but do not
hydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of
salts formed from strong acids and bases are
neutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other
category of salts do undergo hydrolysis.

We now consider the hydrolysis of the
salts of the following types :

(i) salts of weak acid and strong base e.g.,

CH,COONa.

(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g.,
NH,Cl, and

(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g.,
CH,COONH,.

In the first case, CH,COONa being a salt of
weak acid, CH,COOH and strong base, NaOH
gets completely ionised in aqueous solution.
CH,COONa(aq) — CH,COO (aq)+ Na*(aq)

Acetate ion thus formed undergoes
hydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and
OF ions
CH,COO ‘(aq)+H,,O(1)=CH,COOH(aq)+OH (aq)

Acetic acid being a weak acid
(K, = 1.8 x 10°) remains mainly unionised in
solution. This results in increase of OH ion
concentration in solution making it alkaline.
The pH of such a solution is more than 7.

Similarly, NH,Cl formed from weak
base, NH,OH and strong acid, HCl, in water
dissociates completely.

NH,Cl(aq) > NH,(aq) +Ct (aq)

Ammonium ions undergo hydrolysis with
water to form NH,OH and H* ions

NH, (aq) + H,O (1) = NH,OH{(aq) + H*(aq)

Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base

(K, = 1.77 x 10°) and therefore remains
almost unionised in solution. This results in

CHEMISTRY

increased of H* ion concentration in solution
making the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of
NH,Cl solution in water is less than 7.

Consider the hydrolysis of CH,COONH,
salt formed from weak acid and weak base.
The ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:
CH,COO- + NH; + H,O = CH,COOH +

NH,OH

CH,COOH and NH,OH, also remain into

partially dissociated form:

CH,COOH = CH,COO + H*

NH,OH >= NH; + OH

H,O = 4H*+ OH

Without going into detailed calculation,
it can be said that degree of hydrolysis is
independent of concentration of solution, and

pH of such solutions is determined by their
pk values:

pH=7 + '2 (pK, -pK,) (6.38)
The pH of solution can be greater than 7,

if the difference is positive and it will be less
than 7, if the difference is negative.

Problem 6.25

The pK, of acetic acid and pK, of ammonium
hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively.
Calculate the pH of ammonium acetate
solution.

Solution

pH = 7 + % [pK, - pk]
= 7 + 2 [4.76 - 4.75]
=7+'%[0.01] =7+0.005 = 7.005

6.12 BUFFER SOLUTIONS

Many body fluids e.g., blood or urine have
definite pH and any deviation in their pH
indicates malfunctioning of the body. The
control of pH is also very important in
many chemical and biochemical processes.
Many medical and cosmetic formulations
require that these be kept and administered
at a particular pH. The solutions which
resist change in pH on dilution or with
the addition of small amounts of acid or
alkali are called Buffer Solutions. Buffer

EQUILIBRIUM

solutions of known pH can be prepared from
the knowledge of pK, of the acid or pK, of base
and by controlling the ratio of the salt and acid
or salt and base. A mixture of acetic acid and
sodium acetate acts as buffer solution around
pH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride
and ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer
around pH 9.25. You will learn more about
buffer solutions in higher classes.
6.12.1 Designing Buffer Solution
Knowledge of pK,, pK, and equilibrium
constant help us to prepare the buffer solution
of known pH. Let us see how we can do this.
Preparation of Acidic Buffer
To prepare a buffer of acidic pH we use weak
acid and its salt formed with strong base.
We develop the equation relating the pH, the
equilibrium constant, K, of weak acid and
ratio of concentration of weak acid and its
conjugate base. For the general case where
the weak acid HA ionises in water,
HA + H,O 4 H,0* + AY
For which we can write the expression
_[H,O*] [A]
[HA]

Rearranging the expression we have,
[HA]

[A]

Taking logarithm on both the sides and

rearranging the terms we get —

K,

‘a

[H,O*] = K,

[A]
K, =pH-1
pA, =P og [HA]
Or
AW
pH=pkK, + log (6.39)

[Conjugate base, A]
[Acid, HA]

pH=pkK, + log
(6.40)

The expression (6.40) is known as
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The

is the ratio of concentration
[HA]

of conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the

quantity

203

acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a
weak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and
concentration of [HA] is negligibly different
from concentration of acid taken to form
buffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A ],
comes from the ionisation of salt of the acid.
Therefore, the concentration of conjugate
base will be negligibly different from the
concentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40)
takes the form:

[Salt]
[Acid]

In the equation (6.39), if the concentration
of [A] is equal to the concentration of [HA],
then pH = pK, because value of log 1 is zero.
Thus if we take molar concentration of acid
and salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the
buffer solution will be equal to the pK, of the
acid. So for preparing the buffer solution of
the required pH we select that acid whose pK,
is close to the required pH. For acetic acid
pk, value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer
solution formed by acetic acid and sodium
acetate taken in equal molar concentration
will be around 4.76.

A similar analysis of a buffer made with
a weak base and its conjugate acid leads to
the result,

pH=pK, + log

[Conjugate acid, BH*]
[Base, B]

pOH= pk,, +log
(6.41)
pH of the buffer solution can be calculated
by using the equation pH + pOH =14.
We know that pH + pOH = pK, and
pk, + pK, = pK,. On putting these values in
equation (6.41) it takes the form as follows:

pK,,- pH=pK,, — pK, + log

[Conjugate acid, BH" ]

[Base, B]
or

[Conjugate acid, BH" ]
[Base, B]

pH=pkK, + log
(6.42)

If molar concentration of base and its
conjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of
the buffer solution will be same as pK, for the
base. pK, value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore
a buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained
by taking ammonia solution and ammonium

chloride solution of same molar concentration.
For a buffer solution formed by ammonium
chloride and ammonium hydroxide, equation
(6.42) becomes:

[Conjugate acid, BH‘ ]
[Base, B]

pH=9.25+ log

pH of the buffer solution is not affected by
dilution because ratio under the logarithmic
term remains unchanged.

6.13 SOLUBILITY EQUILIBRIA OF
SPARINGLY SOLUBLE SALTS

We have already known that the solubility of
ionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of
these (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that
they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb
water vapour from atmosphere. Others (such
as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility
that they are commonly termed as insoluble.
The solubility depends on a number of factors
important amongst which are the lattice
enthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy
of the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve
in a solvent the strong forces of attraction
between its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be
overcome by the ion-solvent interactions. The
solvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in
terms of solvation which is always negative i.e.
energy is released in the process of solvation.
The amount of solvation enthalpy depends on
the nature of the solvent. In case of a non-
polar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is
small and hence, not sufficient to overcome
lattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the
salt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As
a general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve
in a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy
must be greater than its lattice enthalpy so
that the latter may be overcome by former.
Each salt has its characteristic solubility which
depends on temperature. We classify salts on
the basis of their solubility in the following
three categories.

Soluble |Solubility > 0.1M

Category II | Slightly |0.01M<Solubility< 0.1M
Soluble

Category III | Sparingly| Solubility < 0.01M
Soluble

CHEMISTRY

We shall now consider the equilibrium
between the sparingly soluble ionic salt and
its saturated aqueous solution.

6.13.1 Solubility Product Constant

Let us now have a solid like barium sulphate
in contact with its saturated aqueous solution.
The equilibrium between the undisolved solid
and the ions in a saturated solution can be
represented by the equation:

Ba**(aq) + SO} (aq),

Saturated Solution

BaSO,(s)
in water

The equilibrium constant is given by the
equation:

K = {[Ba*’][SO7}} / [BaSO,]

For a pure solid substance the
concentration remains constant and we can
write

K,, = K[BaSO,] = [Ba?"][SO?} (6.43)

We call K,, the solubility product constant
or simply solubility product. The experimental
value of K,, in above equation at 298K is

1.1x10°!°. This means that for solid barium
sulphate in equilibrium with its saturated
solution, the product of the concentrations
of barium and sulphate ions is equal
to its solubility product constant. The
concentrations of the two ions will be equal to
the molar solubility of the barium sulphate.
If molar solubility is S, then

1.1 x 10°?° = (S)(S) = S?
or S=1.05 x 10°.

Thus, molar solubility of barium sulphate
will be equal to 1.05 x 10° mol L?.

A salt may give on dissociation two or
more than two anions and cations carrying
different charges. For example, consider a salt
like zirconium phosphate of molecular formula
(Zr**),(PO,*),. It dissociates into 3 zirconium
cations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate
anions of charge —-3. If the molar solubility of
zirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen
from the stoichiometry of the compound that

[Zr*] = 3S and [PO] = 4S
and K,, = (3S) (4S)* = 6912 (S)’
or S = {K,, / (3° * 44}/7 = (K,, / 6912)"7

A solid salt of the general formula M?* xy
with molar solubility S in equilibrium with
its saturated solution may be represented by
the equation:

M,X,(s) = xMP*(aq) + yX® (aq)

And its solubility product constant is

S=(K,, / x. yyy (6.45)

The term K,, in equation is given by Q.,
(section 6.6.2) when the concentration of one
or more species is not the concentration under
equilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium
conditions K,, = Q,, but otherwise it gives the
direction of the processes of precipitation or
dissolution. The solubility product constants
of a number of common salts at 298K are
given in Table 6.9.

Calculate the solubility of A,X, in pure
water, assuming that neither kind of ion
reacts with water. The solubility product of
A,X,, K,, = 1.1 x 10%.

Solution

A,X, > 2A* + 3X2

K., = [A*]? [X28 = 1.1 x 10
If S = solubility of A,X,, then
[A*'] = 28; [X?] = 38
therefore, K,, = (2S)*(3S)*° = 108S°

1.1 x 10°8

thus, S° = 1 x 10°5
S = 1.0 x 10° mol/L.

6.13.2 Common Ion Effect on Solubility
of Ionic Salts

It is expected from Le Chatelier’s principle
that if we increase the concentration of any
one of the ions, it should combine with the
ion of its opposite charge and some of the
salt will be precipitated till once again K, =
1

Q..* Similarly, if the concentration of one of
the ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve
to increase the concentration of both the ions
till once again K,, = Q,. This is applicable
even to soluble salts like sodium chloride
except that due to higher concentrations
of the ions, we use their activities instead
of their molarities in the expression for
Q.. Thus if we take a saturated solution of
sodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it,
then sodium chloride is precipitated due to
increased concentration (activity) of chloride
ion available from the dissociation of HCl.
Sodium chloride thus obtained is of very
high purity and we can get rid of impurities
like sodium and magnesium sulphates. The
common ion effect is also used for almost
complete precipitation of a particular ion
as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low
value of solubility product for gravimetric
estimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion
as silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide
(or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as
its sulphate for quantitative estimations.

CHEMISTRY

The solubility of salts of weak acids like
phosphates increases at lower pH. This is
because at lower pH the concentration of the
anion decreases due to its protonation. This
in turn increase the solubility of the salt so
that K,, = Q,,. We have to satisfy two equilibria
simultaneously i.e.,

K,, = [M7] [Xx],
HX (aq) H’(aq)+X (aq);
_[H' (aq) |X (aq)]
*  [HX(aq)|
[X"] / [HX] = K,/[H"]
Taking inverse of both side and adding 1

we get
[Hx], LH’
cal K +1
[Hx]+[H] [H"]+K,
[x] — K,

Now, again taking inverse, we get

[X] / {[X] + [HX]} = f= K,/(K, + [H*]) and it
can be seen that ‘f decreases as pH decreases.
If S is the solubility of the salt at a given
pH then

K,, = [S] [f S] = S? {K,/(K, + [H*])} and

S = {K,, (H'] + K)/K}? (6.46)

Thus solubility S increases with increase
in [H*] or decrease in pH.

EQUILIBRIUM

SUMMARY

When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules
returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in
nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at
this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, K, is
expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the
stoichiometric coefficient.

For reaction, aA+bB = cCt+dD
K, = [Ch[D}*/[APB}

Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the
macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous
reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as K, and is written by replacing concentration
terms by partial pressures in K, expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by
reaction quotient Q. which is equal to K, at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s principle states that
the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the
equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change.
It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration,
pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of
products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition
of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new
lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.

All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids,
bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions
is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes
in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes
there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to
Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous
solutions. Broénsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as
a proton acceptor. When a Brénsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate
base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate
pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an
acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions
for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (K,) and weak bases (K,) are developed
using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and
common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = —log|[H"]) for the hydrogen ion concentration
(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH =— log|OH)]); pK, = —log|K |];
pK, = -log[K,]; and pK, = —log[K,] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we
note that the equation: pH + pOH = pK, is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and
weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in
aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions, and their importance are discussed
briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium
constant is introduced as solubility product constant (K_). Its relationship with solubility
of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions
or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of
sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.
