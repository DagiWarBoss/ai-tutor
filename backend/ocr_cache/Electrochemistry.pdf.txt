Chemical reactions can be used to produce electrical energy,
conversely, electrical energy can be used to carry out chemical
reactions that do not proceed spontaneously.

Electrochemistry is the study of production of
electricity from energy released during spontaneous
chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy
to bring about non-spontaneous chemical
transformations. The subject is of importance both
for theoretical and practical considerations. A large
number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine,
fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by
electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells
convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are
used on a large scale in various instruments and
devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically
can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore,
study of electrochemistry is important for creating new
technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of
sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa
and communication between the cells are known to
have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is
therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In
this Unit, we will cover only some of its important
elementary aspects.

Such a device is called a galvanic or a
voltaic cell.

If an external opposite potential is applied
in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased
slowly, we find that the reaction continues to
take place till the opposing voltage reaches
the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction
stops altogether and no current flows through
the cell. Any further increase in the external
potential again starts the reaction but in the

22 Galvanic @e]ls 4s mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that
converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into
electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous
redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for
running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan,
geyser, etc.

Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following
redox reaction occurs.

Zn(s) + Cu?*(aq) > Zn?* (aq) + Cu(s)

This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition
gives the overall cell reaction:

(i) Cu* + 2e —> Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)
(ii) Zn(s) > Zn?* + 2e (oxidation half reaction) (2.3)

These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.
The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the
oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions
of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper
electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,
the oxidation half-cell.

We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern
of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-
cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two
half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a
switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected
internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both
the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we
do not require a salt bridge.

At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal
ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make
it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode
have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the
electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At
equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the
tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively
or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference
develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called
electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved
in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard
electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard
reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. Ina
galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode
and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other
half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a
positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a
potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the
switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode
to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of
electron flow.

2.2.1
Measurement
of Electrode
Potential

The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic
cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell
potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction
potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive
force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It
is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and
the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic
cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal
and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between
the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention
the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-
cell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the
left hand side i.e.,

Ena = Event ~ Eves

This is illustrated by the following example:

Cell reaction:

Cu(s) + 2Ag*(aq) —> Cu”*(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)
Half-cell reactions:

Cathode (reduction): 2Ag (aq) + 2e > 2Ag(s) (2.5)

Anode (oxidation): Cu(s) > Cu?*(aq) + 2e (2.6)

It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction
(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper
electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:

Cu(s) | Cu*(aq) || Ag’ (aq) | Agts)

and we have E,,., = Event ~ Ete = Eng: lag —

E

Cu" |Cu

(2.7)

The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can
measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that
gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one
electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect
to this. According to convention, a half-cell
called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)
represented by Pt(s) | H,{g) | H*(aq), is assigned
<— H,(g) at a zero potential at all temperatures
1 bar corresponding to the reaction

H’ (aq) +e > 3 HAL)

The standard hydrogen electrode consists
of a platinum electrode coated with platinum
black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic
solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled
through it. The concentration of both the

reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is
Finely divided maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies

platinum coated that th f hvd : b
on platinum foil at the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar
and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the

Fig. 2.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). solution is one molar.

At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode || second
half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode
(reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction
potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and
the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity,
then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, E°, of
the given half-cell.

E° = E°e _ E*.
As E*, for standard hydrogen electrode is zero.
E® = E®,- 0 = E*,

The measured emf of the cell:

Pt(s) | H,(g, 1 bar) | H* (ag, 1 M) || Cu” (aq, 1 M) | Cu

is 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential
of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction:

Cu” (aq, IM) +2e > Cu(s)

Similarly, the measured emf of the cell:

Pt(s) | H,(g, 1 bar) | H* (aq, 1 M) || Zn”* (aq, 1M)| Zn

is -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the
half-cell reaction:

Zn™* (aq, 1 M) + 2e > Zn(s)

The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first
case indicates that Cu” ions get reduced more easily than H ions. The
reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu
(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)
under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not
dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by
hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential
in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or
zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).

In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in
Fig. 2.1 can be written as:

Left electrode: Zn(s) > Zn”* (aq, 1 M)+2e
Right electrode: Cu” (aq, 1 M) + 2 € —> Cu(s)
The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions
and we obtain the equation:
Zn(s) + Cu” (aq) > Zn (aq) + Cu(s)
emf of the cell = E°.. = E°p, — E°,
= 0.34V - (—0.76)V = 1.10 V

Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.
They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for
oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.
For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:

Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H,(g)| H*(aq)
With half-cell reaction: H* (aq)+t e > % H,(g)
Bromine electrode: Pt(s) | Br,(aq)| Br (aq)

35) Electrochemistry

Reprint 2025-26


With half-cell reaction: % Br,(aq) + e€ — Br (aq)

The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can
extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard
electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are
given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode
is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to
hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative
then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.
It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the
highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F,) has the maximum
tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F) and therefore fluorine
gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest
reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating
that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is
the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be
seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard
electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising
power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of
the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical
cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility
product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties
and for potentiometric titrations.

Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential
multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work
from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The
reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs
energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is E and nF is the amount
of charge passed and A.G is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then
AG = — NFE 1 (2.15)
It may be remembered that E,,., is an intensive parameter but A.G
is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on n.
Thus, if we write the reaction

A.G = — 2FE..
but when we write the reaction

Eee = Ev. and we have

2.4 Conductance It is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of
of Ele ctrolyti C conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical
. resistance is represented by the symbol ‘R’ and it is measured in ohm (Q)
Solutions which in terms of SI base units is equal to (kg m?)/(S° A’). It can be
measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are
familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object
is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its
area of cross section, A. That is,
Re ‘ or R=p “
The constant of proportionality, p (Greek, rho), is called resistivity
(specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (Q m) and quite often
its submultiple, ohm centimetre (Q cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends
the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the
rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity
for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area
of cross section is one m?’. It can be seen that:

10Qm= 100 2 cm or 10cm=0.01 Qm

The inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have
the relation:

l1_A A

G Rl 1 (2.18)

The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol

‘S’ and is equal to ohm (also known as mho) or 9”. The inverse of
resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by
the symbol, « (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term
conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term
conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are
S m' but quite often, « is expressed in S cm™'. Conductivity of a
material in S m™ is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area
of cross section is 1 m’. It may be noted that 1 S cm’ = 100 Sm".

It can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity
varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also
depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements
are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and
semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals
and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors.
Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic
polymers” are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass,
ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators.
Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having
conductivity between conductors and insulators are called
semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials
called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite
conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures
(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a
number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show
superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.

Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic
conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic

(i) the nature and structure of the metal
(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom
(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).

* Electronically conducting polymers — In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be
polymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and
conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and
polythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like
carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used
for making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that
one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting
polymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.

As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end,
the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The
mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.

We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10~M) which lend it very low conductivity
(3.5 x 10° Sm’). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish
their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The
conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called
electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic)
solutions depends on:

(i) the nature of the electrolyte added
(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation
iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity
(iv) concentration of the electrolyte
v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).
Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged
period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical
reactions (Section 2.4.1).

molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the
individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus,

Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at
higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in Am
with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and
consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains
1 mol of electrolyte. In such cases Am increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on
dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, Am cannot be
obtained by extrapolation of Am to zero concentration. At infinite dilution
(i.e., concentration c > zero) electrolyte dissociates completely (a =1),
but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low
that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, Am for weak electrolytes
is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions
(Example 2.8). At any concentration c, if a is the degree of dissociation

2.5 Electrolytic In an electrolytic cell external source of voltage is used to bring about
Cells and a chemical reaction. The electrochemical processes are of great importance

. in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic

Electr olysis cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of

copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then
Cu”* ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following
reaction takes place:
Cu**(aq) + 2e° > Cu (s) (2.28)
Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is
converted into Cu”* ions by the reaction:
Cu(s) > Cu**(s) + 2e7 (2.29)
Thus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited
(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in
which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The
impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current
and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg,
Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of
their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents
are available for this purpose.
Sodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of
their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of
aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite.

Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis

Michael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative
aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday’s laws also flow from what has
been discussed earlier.

Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis

After his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts
of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the
form of the following well known Faraday’s two laws of electrolysis:

(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any
electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the
quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or
melt).

(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the
same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution
are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass
of Metal + Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).

There were no constant current sources available during Faraday’s
times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic
cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount
of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However,
coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (J
sources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by

Q = It

Q is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second.

The amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or
reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For
example, in the reaction:

Ag “(aq) +t e& > Ag(s) (2.30)

One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole
of silver ions.

We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 x 107'°C.

Therefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:

N, x 1.6021 x 10°'° C = 6.02 x 10% mol! x 1.6021 x 10°"°
C = 96487 C mol!

This quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by
the symbol F.

For approximate calculations we use 1F ~ 96500 C mol".

For the electrode reactions:

Mg”*(l) + 2e° —> Mg(s) (2.31)
Al**(l) + 3e° —> Al(s) (2.32)

It is obvious that one mole of Mg”* and Al** require 2 mol of electrons
(2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through
the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current
in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals,
current as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about
0.518 F per second.

A solution of CuSO, is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of
1.5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode?

t= 600 s_ charge = current x time = 1.5 A x 600 s = 900 C
According to the reaction:
Cu**(aq) + 2e = Cul(s)
We require 2F or 2 x 96487 C to deposit 1 mol or 63 g of Cu.
For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited

= (63 g mol x 900 C)/(2 x 96487 C mol") = 0.2938 g.

Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being
electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is
inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical
reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other
hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction.
Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert

Reprint 2025-26

electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising
and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard
electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes
although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do
not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to
be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.

For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are
sodium metal and Cl, gas. Here we have only one cation (Na’) which is
reduced at the cathode (Na* + e — Na) and one anion (CI) which is
oxidised at the anode (CI > “Cl, + e). During the electrolysis of aqueous
sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl, and H,. In this
case besides Na‘ and CI ions we also have H* and OH ions along with
the solvent molecules, H,O.

At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction
reactions:

Na® (aq) + & — Na (s) Even) = - 2.71 V

H* (aq) + e& > % H, (g) Even) = 0.00 V

The reaction with higher value of E° is preferred and therefore, the
reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:

H* (aq) + € > % H, (g) (2.33)
but H® (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H,O, i-e.,
H,O (l) > H’ (aq) + OH (aq) (2.34)

Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum
of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have

H,O (l) +e > %4H,{(g) + OH” (2.35)
At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:

CI (aq) > % Cl, Q) te Eve) = 1.36 V (2.36)

2H,0 (1) > O, (g) + 4H"(aq) + 4e€ EQ) = 1.23 V (2.37)

The reaction at anode with lower value of E° is preferred and
therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to CI (aq). However,
on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus,
the net reactions may be summarised as:

NaCl (aq) "hO Nat (aq) + CI” (aq)
Cathode: H,O() + e > % H,{g) + OH (aq)
Anode: Cl (aq) > % CL{(g) + &

Net reaction:
NaCl(aq) + H,O(l) > Na‘(aq) + OH (aq) + 2H,(g) + %Cl,(g)

The standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials
given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration
effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes
are possible at the anode:

space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of
ammonium chloride (NH,Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl,). The
electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written
approximately as follows :

Anode: Zn(s) —> Zn”* + 2e7

Cathode: MnO,+ NH,’+ e—> MnO(OH) + NH,

In the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced
from the + 4 oxidation state to the +3 state. Ammonia
produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn”* to give
[Zn (NH,) AI. The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V.

A secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current
through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A
good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging
and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead
storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and
invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with
lead dioxide (PbO, ) as cathode. A 38% solution of sulphuric acid
is used as an electrolyte.
The cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below:

Anode: Pb(s) + SO,” (aq) — PbSO,(s) + 2e°

Cathode: PbO,(s) + SO 4 (aq) + 4H"(aq) + 2e — PbSO , (s) + 2H,O (1)

i.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is:
Pb(s) + PbO,(s) + 2H,SO,(aq) > 2PbSO,(s) + 2H,O()

On charging the battery the reaction is reversed and PbSO,(s) on
anode and cathode is converted into Pb and PbO,, respectively.

Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method
and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy
(heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for
converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run
a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly
converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is
now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously
to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the
electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert
the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol,
etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.

H,O One of the most successful fuel cells

+,Cathode uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen

to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was
used for providing electrical power in the
Apollo space programme. The water
vapours produced during the reaction
were condensed and added to the
drinking water supply for the astronauts.
In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are
bubbled through porous carbon
electrodes into concentrated aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like
finely divided platinum or palladium
metal are incorporated into the electrodes
for increasing the rate of electrode
reactions. The electrode reactions are
given below:

Cathode: O,(g) + 2H,O(1) + 4e—- 40H (aq)
Anode: 2H, (g) + 40H (aq) —~> 4H,O()) + 4e€
Overall reaction being:

2H,(g) + O,(g) —> 2H,O(1)

The cell runs continuously as long as the reactants are supplied.
Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about 70 % compared

Reprint 2025-26

to thermal plants whose efficiency is about 40%. There has been
tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials,
better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells.
These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel
cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety
of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried.

2.8 Corrosion Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or
other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver,
development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the

examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to

buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of
metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees
every year on account of corrosion.

In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons
to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron
(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of
water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite

complex but it may be considered
essentially as an electrochemical
phenomenon. At a particular spot
) (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron,
oxidation takes place and that spot

Oxidation: Fe (s)> Fe” (aq) +2e

Reduction: O, (g) + 4H*(aq) +4e€° > 2H,O())

Atomospheric

oxidation: 2Fe”*(aq) + 2H,O() + %20,(g) > Fe,O,(s) + 4H"(aq

Fig. 2.13: Corrosion of iron in atmosphere behaves as anode and we can write
the reaction
Anode: 2 Fe (s) —> 2 Fe** + 4 & E pe2/re =- 0.44 V

Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go
to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H*
(which is believed to be available from H,CO, formed due to dissolution
of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also
be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the
atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction

Cathode: O,(g) + 4 H"(aq) + 4 & —> 2 H,0 (1) Eno, wo 123V
The overall reaction being:
2Fe(s) + O,(g) + 4H"(aq) —> 2Fe? *(aq) + 2 H,O ()) Even =1.67 V

The ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to
ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide
(Fe,O,. x H,O) and with further production of hydrogen ions.

Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves
money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse
or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest
methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic
object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering
the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another
simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that
are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to
provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which
corrodes itself but saves the object.

The

At present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels
such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their
standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per
capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it
is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted.
We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil
fuels is resulting in the ‘Greenhouse Effect’. This is leading to a rise in the
temperature of the Earth’s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels
to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations
such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope,
we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal
alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must
come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used
as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the
Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water
and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And
both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.

Summar

An electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic
solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic
conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell,
the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical
work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-
spontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode
dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode
potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell
can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and

anode (EP) = E°cathode — E°anode). The standard potential of the cells are

related to standard Gibbs energy (A;G° = -nF E?.u)) and equilibrium constant
(ArG° = —- RT In K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence
of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.

The conductivity, «, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration
of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, An, is
defined by = «/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar
conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with
decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep
for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar
conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the

molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of
independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity
through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the
electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful
forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical
phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy.
