13.1 INTRODUCTION

In our daily life we come across various kinds of motions.
You have already learnt about some of them, e.g., rectilinear
motion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are
non-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular
motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In
these cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of
time, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have
enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both
these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the
periodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro
about a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes
a similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro
motion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the
piston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a
motion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we
study this motion.

The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its
concepts are required for the understanding of many physical
phenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar
or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce
pleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms
in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about
their mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make
the propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate
about their equilibrium positions, the average energy of
vibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power
supply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive
and negative about the mean value (zero).

The description of a periodic motion, in general, and
oscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental
concepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude
and phase. These concepts are developed in the next section.

13.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS

Fig. 13.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose
an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it
comes back to the initial point and repeats the
process identically. If you draw a graph of its
height above the ground versus time, it would
look something like Fig. 13.1 (a). Ifa child climbs
up a step, comes down, and repeats the process
identically, its height above the ground would
look like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the
game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between
your palm and the ground, its height versus time
graph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c).
Note that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c)
are sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s
equation of motion (see section 2.6),

1
h=ut +5 gt” for downward motion, and

h=ut —- 3 gt” for upward motion,

with different values of u in each case. These
are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion
that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is
called periodic motion.

is shown in each case.

Very often, the body undergoing periodic
motion has an equilibrium position somewhere
inside its path. When the body is at this position
no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if itis
left there at rest, it remains there forever. If the
body is given a small displacement from the
position, a force comes into play which tries to
bring the body back to the equilibrium point,
giving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For
example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in
equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little
from the point, it will perform oscillations in the
bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but
every periodic motion need not be oscillatory.
Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is
not oscillatory.

There is no significant difference between
oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when
the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,
the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when
the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,
the vibration of a string of a musical instrument).

Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form
of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when
the force on the oscillating body is directly
proportional to its displacement from the mean
position, which is also the equilibrium position.
Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force
is directed towards the mean position.

In practice, oscillating bodies eventually
come to rest at their equilibrium positions
because of the damping due to friction and other
dissipative causes. However, they can be forced
to remain oscillating by means of some external
periodic agency. We discuss the phenomena of
damped and forced oscillations later in the
chapter.

Any material medium can be pictured as a
collection of a large number of coupled
oscillators. The collective oscillations of the
constituents of a medium manifest themselves
as waves. Examples of waves include water
waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves.
We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next
chapter.

13.2.1 Period and frequency

We have seen that any motion that repeats itself
at regular intervals of time is called periodic
motion. The smallest interval of time after
which the motion is repeated is called its
period. Let us denote the period by the symbol
T. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,

Reprint 2025-26

OSCILLATIONS

261

which are either too fast or too slow on the scale
of seconds, other convenient units of time are
used. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal
is expressed in units of microseconds (10° s)
abbreviated as us. On the other hand, the orbital
period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days.
The Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years.

The reciprocal of T gives the number of
repetitions that occur per unit time. This
quantity is called the frequency of the periodic
motion. It is represented by the symbol v. The
relation between v and Tis

v =1/T (13.1)

The unit of v is thus s'. After the discoverer of
radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857-1894),
a special name has been given to the unit of
frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz).
Thus,

1 hertz = 1 Hz =1 oscillation per second =1 s"!
(13.2)

Note, that the frequency, v, is not necessarily
an integer.

Example 13.1 On an average, a human

heart is found to beat 75 times in a minute.
Calculate its frequency and period.

Answer The beat frequency of heart = 75/(1 min)
= 75/(60 s)
=1.25s1

= 1.25 Hz

= 1/(1.25 s°})
=0.8s <

13.2.2 Displacement

In section 3.2, we defined displacement of a
particle as the change in its position vector. In
this chapter, we use the term displacement
in a more general sense. It refers to change
with time of any physical property under
consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear
motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance
from the starting point as a function of time is
its position displacement. The choice of origin
is a matter of convenience. Consider a block
attached to a spring, the other end of the spring
is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig. 13.2(a)]. Generally,
it is convenient to measure displacement of the
body from its equilibrium position. For an
oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the
vertical as a function of time may be regarded

as a displacement variable [see Fig. 13.2(b)]. The
term displacement is not always to be referred

end of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The
block moves on a frictionless surface. The
motion of the block can be described in

terms of its distance or displacement x
from the equilibrium position.

in the context of position only. There can be
many other kinds of displacement variables. The
voltage across a capacitor, changing with time
in an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable.
In the same way, pressure variations in time in
the propagation of sound wave, the changing
electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are
examples of displacement in different contexts.
The displacement variable may take both
positive and negative values. In experiments on
oscillations, the displacement is measured for
different times.

The displacement can be represented by a
mathematical function of time. In case of periodic
motion, this function is periodic in time. One of
the simplest periodic functions is given by

f(t =Acos ot (13.3a)
If the argument of this function, ot, is

increased by an integral multiple of 27 radians,
the value of the function remains the same. The

function f(t) is then periodic and its period, T,
is given by

_ 20

T (13.3b)

a)
Thus, the function f(d) is periodic with period T,

f(0 =f(t+T)

The same result is obviously correct if we
consider a sine function, f(t) =A sin ot. Further,
a linear combination of sine and cosine functions
like,

f(t) = Asin ot + Bcos ot (13.3c)
is also a periodic function with the same period
T. Taking,

A=Dcos ¢ and B=Dsin ¢
Eq. (13.3c) can be written as,
f() =Dsin (at + 6), (13.3d)

Here Dand ¢ are constant given by

B

p=,/A?+B? and = tan! A

The great importance of periodic sine and

cosine functions is due to a remarkable result

proved by the French mathematician, Jean

Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830): Any

periodic function can be expressed as a

superposition of sine and cosine functions

of different time periods with suitable
coefficients.

Example 13.2 Which of the following
functions of time represent (a) periodic and
(b) non-periodic motion? Give the period for
each case of periodic motion [mis any

positive constant].

(i) sin wt+cos ot

(ii) sin ot + cos 2 of sin 4 ot
(iii) e

(iv) log (ad)

Answer

(i) sin wt+cos otis a periodic function, it can
also be written as J2 sin (ot + 1/4).

Nowy2 sin (ot +2/H=/2 sin (at + 1/44+27)
= /2 sin [a(t + 2z/o) + 7/4]

The periodic time of the function is 2x/o.

(ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It
can be noted that each term represents a
periodic function with a different angular
frequency. Since period is the least interval
of time after which a function repeats its
value, sin thas a period T,= 2n/@ ; cos 2 ot
has a period r/@=T,/2; and sin 4 othasa
period 2/4 = T,/4. The period of the first
term is a multiple of the periods of the last
two terms. Therefore, the smallest interval
of time after which the sum of the three
terms repeats is T,, and thus, the sum isa
periodic function with a period 21/a.

(iii) The function e® is not periodic, it
decreases monotonically with increasing
time and tends to zero as t—> o and thus,
never repeats its value.

(iv) The function log(@t) increases
monotonically with time ¢. It, therefore,
never repeats its value and is a non-
periodic function. It may be noted that as
t > «, log(wé) diverges to o. It, therefore,
cannot represent any kind of physical
displacement.

13.3. SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

Consider a particle oscillating back and forth
about the origin of an x-axis between the limits
+A and —Aas shown in Fig. 13.3. This oscillatory
motion is said to be simple harmonic if the
displacement x of the particle from the origin
varies with time as :

x(Q =Acos (@ t+ ¢) (13.4)

-A tA
SS

the origin of x-axis, between the limits +A
and —A.

where A, wand ¢are constants.

Thus, simple harmonic motion (SHM) is not
any periodic motion but one in which
displacement is a sinusoidal function of time.
Fig. 13.4 shows the positions of a particle
executing SHM at discrete value of time, each
interval of time being T/4, where Tis the period

itself is T. T will remain fixed, no matter
what location you choose as the initial (t =
O) location. The speed is maximum for zero
displacement (at x = O) and zero at the
extremes of motion.

o and ¢ which characterize a given SHM have
standard names, as summarised in Fig. 13.6.
Let us understand these quantities.

The amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude
of maximum displacement of the particle.

varies between the extremes A and - A. Two
simple harmonic motions may have same @

shown in Fig. 13.7 (a).

argument (at + ¢) in the cosine function. This
time-dependent quantity, (@t + ¢) is called the
phase of the motion. The value of plase at t= 0
is ¢ and is called the phase constant (or phase
angle). If the amplitude is known, ¢ can be
determined from the displacement at t= 0. Two
simple harmonic motions may have the same A
and @ but different phase angle ¢, as shown in
Fig. 13.7 (b).

Finally, the quantity @ can be seen to be
related to the period of motion T. Taking, for

x(t) = Acos ot (13.5)

Since the motion has a period T, x (#) is equal to
xX (t+ T). That is,

Acos ot=Acos a(t + T) (13.6)

Now the cosine function is periodic with period
2n, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument
changes by 27. Therefore,

A&(t+T)= ot+ 2n

that is @ = 2n/ T (13.7)

o is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its
S.I. unit is radians per second. Since the
frequency of oscillations is simply 1/T, o is 2x
times the frequency of oscillation. Two simple
harmonic motions may have the same A and 9,
but different w, as seen in Fig. 13.8. In this plot
the curve (b) has half the period and twice the
frequency of the curve (a).

13.4 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND
UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

In this section, we show that the projection of
uniform circular motion on a diameter of the
circle follows simple harmonic motion. A
simple experiment (Fig. 13.9) helps us visualise
this connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string
and make it move in a horizontal plane about
a fixed point with a constant angular speed.
The ball would then perform a uniform circular
motion in the horizontal plane. Observe the
ball sideways or from the front, fixing your
attention in the plane of motion. The ball will
appear to execute to and fro motion along a
horizontal line with the point of rotation as
the midpoint. You could alternatively observe
the shadow of the ball on a wall which is
perpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this
process what we are observing is the motion
of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal
to the direction of viewing.

Fig. 13.9 Circular motion ofa ballin a plane viewed
edge-on is SHM.

Fig. 13.10 describes the same situation
mathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving
uniformly on a circle of radius A with angular
speed w. The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.
The initial position vector of the particle, i-e.,

the vector Op at t= 0 makes an angle of ¢ with

the positive direction of x-axis. In time ¢ it will
cover a further angle wt and its position vector

Reprint 2025-26

OSCILLATIONS

Fig. 13.10

will make an angle of wt + ¢ with the +ve
x-axis. Next, consider the projection of the
position vector OP on the x-axis. This will be
OP’. The position of P’ on the x-axis, as the
particle P moves on the circle, is given by
x(t) = Acos (@t+ ¢)

which is the defining equation of SHM. This
shows that if P moves uniformly on a circle,
its projection P’ on a diameter of the circle
executes SHM. The particle P and the circle
on which it moves are sometimes referred to
as the reference particle and the reference circle,
respectively.

We can take projection of the motion of P on
any diameter, say the y-axis. In that case, the
displacement y(4 of P’ on the y-axis is given by

y=Asin (ot + ¢)
which is also an SHM of the same amplitude
as that of the projection on x-axis, but differing
by a phase of 2/2.

In spite of this connection between circular
motion and SHM, the force acting on a particle
in linear simple harmonic motion is very
different from the centripetal force needed to
keep a particle in uniform circular motion.

depicts two circular motions. The radius
of the circle, the period of revolution, the
initial position and the sense of revolution
are indicated in the figures. Obtain the
simple harmonic motions of the

* The natural unit of angle is radian, defined through the ratio of arc to radius. Angle is a dimensionless
quantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use 7, its multiples
or submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and
centimetre or mile. Ifthe argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood
that the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be
shown explicitly. For example, sin(15°) means sine of 15 degree, but sin(15) means sine of 15 radians.
Hereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is
mentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians.

13.5 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION, IN
SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

The speed of a particle v in uniform circular
motion is its angular speed @ times the radius
of the circle A.

V=0A (13.8)

The direction of velocity y at a time tis along
the tangent to the circle at the point where the
particle is located at that instant. From the
geometry of Fig. 13.11, it is clear that the velocity
of the projection particle P’ at time tis

V(t) = -@A sin (at + ¢) (13.9)

Fig. 13.11 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P’ is
the projection of the velocity w of the
reference particle, P.

where the negative sign shows that v(t) has a
direction opposite to the positive direction of
x-axis. Eq. (13.9) gives the instantaneous
velocity of a particle executing SHM, where
displacement is given by Eq. (13.4). We can, of
course, obtain this equation without using
geometrical argument, directly by differentiating
(Eq. 13.4) with respect of t:

v(t = x(t) (13.10)

The method of reference circle can be similarly
used for obtaining instantaneous acceleration
of a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the
centripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform
circular motion has a magnitude v/A or A,
and it is directed towards the centre i.e., the
direction is along PO. The instantaneous
acceleration of the projection particle P’ is then
(See Fig. 13.12)

a(Q =-a@*Acos (at + ¢)
= -«2x (0 (13.11)

Fig. 13.12 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P’ is
the projection of the acceleration a of the
reference particle P.

Eq. (13.11) gives the acceleration of a particle
in SHM. The same equation can again be
obtained directly by differentiating velocity Vd
given by Eq. (13.9) with respect to time:

d
= (13.12)
a(t) ae v(t)

We note from Eq. (13.11) the important
property that acceleration of a particle in SHM
is proportional to displacement. For x(t) > 0,
a(Q <Oand for x( < 0, a(t > 0. Thus, whatever

the value of xbetween —A and A, the acceleration
a(t) is always directed towards the centre.

For simplicity, let us put ¢ = O and write the
expression for x (4, v(Q and a()

The corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 13.13.
All quantities vary sinusoidally with time; only
their maxima differ and the different plots differ
in phase. x varies between —A to A; v({) varies
from —@A to w@A and a(f) from —@*A to w?A. With
respect to displacement plot, velocity plot has a
phase difference of z/2 and acceleration plot has
a phase difference of z.

13.6 FORCE LAW FOR SIMPLE HARMONIC
MOTION

Using Newton’s second law of motion, and the
expression for acceleration of a particle
undergoing SHM (Eq. 13.11), the force acting
on a particle of mass min SHM is

F(t) =ma
= mw? x (t)
ie., F(t) =-k x(t) (13.13)
where k=ma (13.14a)
or o= Ke (13.14b)
m

Like acceleration, force is always directed
towards the mean position—hence it is sometimes
called the restoring force in SHM. To summarise
the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can
be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq.
(13.4) for displacement or by Eq. (13.13) that gives
its force law. Going from Eq. (13.4) to Eq. (13.13)
required us to differentiate two times. Likewise,
by integrating the force law Eq. (13.13) two times,
we can get back Eq. (13.4).

Note that the force in Eq. (13.13) is linearly
proportional to x(). A particle oscillating under
such a force is, therefore, calling a linear
harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force
may contain small additional terms proportional
to x’, x°, etc. These then are called non-linear
oscillators.

spring constant k are attached to a block
of mass mand to fixed supports as shown

Answer Let the mass be displaced by a small
distance x to the right side of the equilibrium
position, as shown in Fig. 13.15. Under this
situation the spring on the left side gets

the right side gets compressed by the same
length. The forces acting on the mass are
then,

F, =-k-x (force exerted by the spring on

position)

Hence the force acting on the mass is
proportional to the displacement and is directed
towards the mean position; therefore, the motion

13.7 ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

Both kinetic and potential energies of a particle
in SHM vary between zero and their maximum
values.

In section 13.5 we have seen that the velocity
of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic
function of time. It is zero at the extreme positions
of displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (A)
of such a particle, which is defined as

2

= , mo’ A’ sin” (at + ¢)

= Sk A? sin*(ot + §) (13.15)

is also a periodic function of time, being zero
when the displacement is maximum and
maximum when the particle is at the mean
position. Note, since the sign of vis immaterial
in K, the period of Kis T/2.

What is the potential energy (U) of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion? In
Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of
potential energy is possible only for conservative
forces. The spring force F = —kxis a conservative
force, with associated potential energy

Hence the potential energy of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion is,

=ok A’ cos” (at + g) (13.17)

Thus, the potential energy of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion is also
periodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean
position and maximum at the extreme
displacements.

It follows from Eqs. (13.15) and (13.17) that
the total energy, E, of the system is,

E=U+K

=o kA cos’ (at + ¢) oka sin’ (at + )

The total mechanical energy of a harmonic
oscillator is thus independent of time as
expected for motion under any conservative
force. The time and displacement dependence
of the potential and kinetic energies of a
linear simple harmonic oscillator are shown

energy as a function of time [shown in (a)]
and displacement [shown in (b)] ofa particle
in SHM. The kinetic energy and potential
energy both repeat after a period T/2. The
total energy remains constant at all t or x.

Observe that both kinetic energy and
potential energy in SHM are seen to be always
positive in Fig. 13.16. Kinetic energy can, of
course, be never negative, since it is
proportional to the square of speed. Potential
energy is positive by choice of the undermined
constant in potential energy. Both kinetic
energy and potential energy peak twice during
each period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is
kinetic; at the extremes x = +A, it is all
potential energy. In the course of motion
between these limits, kinetic energy increases
at the expense of potential energy or
vice-versa.

Or cos (7.070) = 0.5 and hence

sin (7.070) 8 = 0.866
Then, the velocity of the block at x= 5 cm is

The total energy of the block at x= 5 cm,

= K.E. + P.E.
= 0.25J

we also know that at maximum displacement,
K.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the
system is equal to the P.E. Therefore, the total

energy of the system,
= %(50 Nm! x 0.1 mx 0.1m)

=0.25J
which is same as the sum of the two energies at
a displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity
with the principle of conservation ofenergy. <4

13.8 The Simple Pendulum

It is said that Galileo measured the periods ofa
swinging chandelier in a church by his pulse
beats. He observed that the motion of the
chandelier was periodic. The system is a kind
of pendulum. You can also make your own
pendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long
unstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm
long. Suspend your pendulum from a suitable
support so that it is free to oscillate. Displace
the stone to one side by a small distance and

let it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion,
it is periodic with a period of about two seconds.

We shall show that this periodic motion is
simple harmonic for small displacements from

—asmall bob of mass m tied to an inextensible
massless string of length L. The other end of
the string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob

system. Fig. 13.17(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’

forces acting on the bob.

force due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be
resolved into the component mg cos0 along the
string and mg sin@ perpendicular to it. Since
the motion of the bob is along a circle of length
Land centre at the support point, the bob has
a radial acceleration (@’Z) and also a tangental
acceleration; the latter arises since motion along
the arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial
acceleration is provided by the net radial force
T-mg cos, while the tangential acceleration is
provided by mg sin®. It is more convenient to
work with torque about the support since the
radial force gives zero torque. Torque t about
the support is entirely provided by the tangental
component of force

t= -L(mgsin@) (13.19)

This is the restoring torque that tends to reduce
angular displacement — hence the negative
sign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,

t =lIa (13.20)

where J is the moment of inertia of the system
about the support and oa is the angular
acceleration. Thus,

Ta=-mgsind L (13.21)
Or,
a = mon sin (13.22)

We can simplify Eq. (13.22) if we assume that
the displacement 6 is small. We know that sin 0
can be expressed as,

3 5

sin = —+—t... (13.23)
3! 5!

where @is in radians.
Now if 6 is small, sin 0 can be approximated
by @ and Eq. (13.22) can then be written as,

a= -——8@ (13.24)

In Table 13.1, we have listed the angle 9 in
degrees, its equivalent in radians, and the
value of the function sin 0. From this table it
can be seen that for 6 as large as 20 degrees,
sin 9 is nearly the same as 9 expressed
in radians.

SUMMARY

The motion that repeats itself is called periodlic motion.
The period Tis the time reequired for one complete oscillation, or cycle. It is related to
the frequency v by,

T=
v

The frequency v of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per
unit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :

1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = Is?

In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the displacement x (4) of a particle from its
equilibrium position is given by,

x(Q =Acos (at + ¢) (displacement),

in which A is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity (wt + ¢) is the phase of
the motion, and ¢ is the phase constant. The angular frequency o is related to the
period and frequency of the motion by,

24
= =24 (angular frequency).

Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular
motion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.

The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,
v(Q = -@A sin (@t+ ¢) (velocity),

a(Q = -ow’Acos (at + ¢)

-w°x (0 (acceleration),

Thus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic
motion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude v,=@ A and acceleration
amplitude a, =o 7A, respectively.

The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and
is always directed towards the centre of motion.

A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy
K = % mv’ and potential energy U = 4% kx’. If no friction is present the mechanical
energy of the system, E = K + Ualways remains constant even though Kand Uchange
with time.

POINTS TO PONDER

The period Tis the least time after which motion repeats itself. Thus, motion repeats
itself after nT where n is an integer.

Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion
governed by the force law F = — k xis simple harmonic.

Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in:planetary motion)
as well as due to simple harmonic force in two,dimensions equal to:-—mo?r. In the
latter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ
by 1/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force -mwr with initial position (0,
A) and velocity (@A, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.

For linear simple harmonic motion with a given @, two initial conditions are necessary
and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial conditions may be (i)
initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy
and phase.

From point 4 above, given amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the
initial position or initial velocity:

A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases
is not necessarily periodic. It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral
multiple of the other’sfrequency. However, a periodic motion can always be expressed
as a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.

The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant.
Contrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler’s third law).

The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.

For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement x must be expressible
in either of the following forms :

x=Acos ot + Bsin at
x=Acos (at+a), x= Bsin (at + B)

The three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any
other two forms).

Thus, damped simple harmonic motion is not strictly simple harmonic. It is
approximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/b where bis the damping
constant.
