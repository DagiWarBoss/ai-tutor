8.1 Introduction

In mathematics, the word, “sequence” is used in much the
same way as it is in ordinary English. When we say that a
collection of objects is listed in a sequence, we usually mean
that the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an
identified first member, second member, third member and
so on. For example, population of human beings or bacteria
at different times form a sequence. The amount of money
deposited in a bank, over a number of years form a sequence.
Depreciated values of certain commodity occur in a
sequence. Sequences have important applications in several Fibonacci
spheres of human activities. (1175-1250)
Sequences, following specific patterns are called progressions. In previous class,
we have studied about arithmetic progression (A.P). In this Chapter, besides discussing
more about A.P.; arithmetic mean, geometric mean, relationship between A.M.

and G.M., special series in forms of sum to n terms of consecutive natural numbers,
sum to n terms of squares of natural numbers and sum to n terms of cubes of
natural numbers will also be studied.

8.2 Sequences
Let us consider the following examples:

Assume that there is a generation gap of 30 years, we are asked to find the
number of ancestors, i.e., parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. that a person
might have over 300 years.

Here, the total number of generations — 300 =10

The number of person’s ancestors for the first, second, third, ..., tenth generations are
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 1024. These numbers form what we call a sequence.

Consider the successive quotients that we obtain in the division of 10 by 3 at
different steps of division. In this process we get 3,3.3,3.33,3.333, ... and so on. These
quotients also form a sequence. The various numbers occurring in a sequence are
called its terms. We denote the terms of a sequence by a, a, ay ..., a, ..., etc., the
subscripts denote the position of the term. The n" term is the number at the n" position
of the sequence and is denoted by a, The n" term is also called the general term of the
sequence. )

Thus, the terms of the sequence of person’s ancestors mentioned above are:
a, =2,a,=4, a, = 8, ..., a, = 1024.
Similarly, in the example of successive quotients
a, = 3, a, = 3.3, a, = 3.33, ..., a, = 3.33333, ete.

A sequence containing finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. For
example, sequence of ancestors is a finite sequence since it contains 10 terms (a fixed
number).

A sequence is called infinite, if it is not a finite sequence. For example, the
sequence of successive quotients mentioned above is an infinite sequence, infinite in
the sense that it never ends.

Often, it is possible to express the rule, which yields the various terms of a sequence
in terms of algebraic formula. Consider for instance, the sequence of even natural
numbers 2, 4, 6, ...

Here a,=2=2x1 a,=4=2x2

a,=6=2 x 3 a,=8=2%x4

a,,= 46 = 2 x 23, a,,= 48 = 2 x 24, and so on.

In fact, we see that the n term of this sequence can be written as a, = 2n,
where 7 is a natural number. Similarly, in the sequence of odd natural numbers 1,3,5, ...,
the n" term is given by the formula, a, = 2 — 1, where n is a natural number.

In some cases, an arrangement of numbers such as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,.. has no visible
pattern, but the sequence is generated by the recurrence relation given by

a,=a,=1
a, =a,+ a,
a,=a,,+a,,n>2

n n-2

This sequence is called Fibonacci sequence.

SEQUENCES AND SERIES 137

In the sequence of primes 2,3,5,7,..., we find that there is no formula for the n™
prime. Such sequence can only be described by verbal description.

In every sequence, we should not expect that its terms will necessarily be given
by a specific formula. However, we expect a theoretical scheme or a rule for generating
the terms a,, d,,4,,...,d,,... IN Succession.

In view of the above, a sequence can be regarded as a function whose domain
is the set of natural numbers or some subset of it. Sometimes, we use the functional
notation a(n) for ay.

8.3 Series

Let a,, a,,d,,...,a,, be a given sequence. Then, the expression

a, t a,ta, yee a, Fo,

is called the series associated with the given sequence .The series is finite or infinite
according as the given sequence is finite or infinite. Series are often represented in

compact form, called sigma notation, using the Greek letter ¥ (sigma) as means of
indicating the summation involved. Thus, the series a, + a, +a,+...+a, is abbreviated

n
as Nay
k=1 .

Remark When the series 1s used, it refers to the indicated sum not to the sum itself.
For example, | +3 +5 +7 is a finite series with four terms. When we use the phrase
“sum of a series,” we will mean the number that results from adding the terms, the
sum of the series is 16.

We now consider some examples.

Example 1 Write the first three terms in each of the following sequences defined by
the following:

n-3

(i) a,=2n+5, (ii) a, = 4

Solution (i) Here a, = 2n + 5
Substituting n = 1, 2, 3, we get
a, =2(1)+5=7, a,=9,a,= 11

Therefore, the required terms are 7, 9 and 11.

(ii) Here a, = n> . Thus, % a ay = a; =0

140 MATHEMATICS

As in case of arithmetic progression, the problem of finding the n term or sum of n
terms of a geometric progression containing a large number of terms would be difficult
without the use of the formulae which we shall develop in the next Section. We shall
use the following notations with these formulae:

a = the first term, r = the common ratio, / = the last term,
n = the numbers of terms,
S, = the sum of first 1 terms.

8.4.1 General term of a G.P. Let us consider a GP. with first non-zero term ‘a’ and
common ratio ‘7’. Write a few terms of it. The second term is obtained by multiplying
a by r, thus a, = ar. Similarly, third term is obtained by multiplying a, by r. Thus,
a, = ay = ar’, and so on.

We write below these and few more terms.
Is term = a, = a= ar'', 2" term = a, = ar = ar*", 3" term = a, = ar’ = ar’!
4" term = a, = ar’ = ar*', 5" term = a, = art = ar’!
Do you see a pattern? What will be 16" term?

a= ar'* = ars
Therefore, the pattern suggests that the n term of a GP. is given by

a =ar"'!,"
n

Thus, a, GP. can be written as a, ar, ar’, ar, .... ar" |; a, ar, ar’,...,ar"~ |... ;according
as G.P. is finite or infinite, respectively.
The series a+ art+tar+...t+ ar! orat+art+ar+...+ ar’! +...are called

finite or infinite geometric series, respectively.

8.4.2. Sum to n terms of a G.P. Let the first term of a GP. be a and the common
ratio be r. Let us denote by S_ the sum to first n terms of GP. Then

S =a+ar+ ar +...+ ar"! . (1)

Case 2 If r+#1, multiplying (1) by 7, we have

Subtracting (2) from (1), we get (1 —r) S_ = a—ar" =a(1 —-r')

This gives 48 = 4r-l.
So that n — 1 = 8, i.e., = 9. Hence, 131072 is the 9" term of the GP.

SEQUENCES AND SERIES 149

Summary

© By a sequence, we mean an arrangement of number in definite order according
to some rule. Also, we define a sequence as a function whose domain is the
set of natural numbers or some subsets of the type {1, 2, 3, ....k}. Asequence
containing a finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. A sequence is
called infinite if it is not a finite sequence.

@ Leta, a, a,, ... be the sequence, then the sum expressed as a, + a, +a, +...
is called series. A series is called finite series if it has got finite number of
terms.

@ A sequence is said to be a geometric progression or G-P., if the ratio of any
term to its preceding term is same throughout. This constant factor is called
the common ratio. Usually, we denote the first term of a GP. by a and its
common ratio by r. The general or the n® term of GP. is given by a= ar’~'.
The sum S_ of the first n terms of G.P. is given by

5 - a(r" — 1)

Sj or te") ifr#l

@ The geometric mean (G.M.) of any two positive numbers a and 6 is given by

Jab 1.e., the sequence a, G, b is GP.

Historical Note

Evidence is found that Babylonians, some 4000 years ago, knew of arithmetic and
geometric sequences. According to Boethius (510), arithmetic and geometric
sequences were known to early Greek writers. Among the Indian mathematician,
Aryabhatta (476) was the first to give the formula for the sum of squares and cubes
of natural numbers in his famous work Aryabhatiyam, written around
499. He also gave the formula for finding the sum to n terms of an arithmetic
sequence starting with p" term. Noted Indian mathematicians Brahmgupta

150 MATHEMATICS

(598), Mahavira (850) and Bhaskara (1114-1185) also considered the sum of squares
and cubes. Another specific type of sequence having important applications in
mathematics, called Fibonacci sequence, was discovered by Italian mathematician
Leonardo Fibonacci (1170-1250). Seventeenth century witnessed the classification
of series into specific forms. In 1671 James Gregory used the term infinite series in
connection with infinite sequence. It was only through the rigorous development of
algebraic and set theoretic tools that the concepts related to sequence and series
could be formulated suitably.
