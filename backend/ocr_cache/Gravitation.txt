‘about 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ mode! in which all
Celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets all evolved
‘around the earth. ‘The only motion that was thought to be
possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle
‘Complicated schemes of mation were put forward by Ptolemy
inorder to describe the observed motion ofthe planets. The
planets were described as moving in circles with the centre
ff the circles themselves moving in larger circles. Similar
theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some
4400 years later. However a more elegant model in which the
‘Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved - the
‘heliocentric’ model - was already mentioned by Aryabhatta
(5 century AD.) in his treatise. A thousand years later, a
Polish monk named Nicolas Copernicus (1473-1543)


proposed a definitive model in which the planets
moved in circles around a fixed central sun. His
theory was discredited by the church, but
notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who
hhad to face prosecution from the state for his
beliefs

twas around the same time as Galileo, a
nobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)
Falling from Denmark, spent his entire lfetime
recording observations of the planets with the
naked eve. His compiled data were analysed
later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (1571-
1640}. He could extract from the data three
legant laws that now go by the name of Kepler's
laws. ‘These laws were known to Newton and
cabled him to make a great sclentiie leap in
proposing his universal law of gravitation,

7.2 KEPLER'SLAWS

‘The three laws of Kepler can be stated as
follows

1. Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical
ofbits with the Sun sttuated at one of the foci

of the ellipse (Fig. 7-1a). This law was a
deviation from the Copernican model which
allowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of
Which the circle Is a special case. is a elosed
curve which can be drawn very simply as
follows.

Select two points F, and F,. Take a length

ofa string and. fix its ends at F, and F, by
pins. With the tip ofa pencil stretch the string
faut and then draw a curve by moving the
pencil Keeping the string taut throughout. (Fig.
7.1(0)) The closed curve you get is called an
ellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse.
the stm of the distances from F, and F, is a
constant. F,,F, are called the foe. Jota the
points F,and F, and extend the line to

the centre ofthe ellipse O and the length PO
AO s.alled the semi-major axis ofthe ellipse.
For a circle, the two focit merge into one and
the sem!-major axis becomes the radius of the
crete.
2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet
to the sun sweeps equal areas in equal
Intervals of time (Fig. 7.2). This law comes from
the observations that planets appear to move
slower when they are. farther from the sun
than when they are nearer.

fof revolution of a planet is proportional to the
‘cube of the semi-major ax ofthe ellipse traced

‘The law of arcas can be understood as @
consequence of conservation of angular
momentum whch is valid for any central
force .A central force is such that the force
fn the planet is along the vector joining the
Sun and the planet. Let the Sun be at the
origin and let the position and momentum,
of the planet be denoted by r and p
respectively. Then the area swept out by the

the law of areas. Gravitation is a central force

7:9 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION
Legend has it that observing an apple falling from
fa tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an
‘universal law of gravitation that led to an
‘explanation of terrestrial gravitation as well as
fof Kepler's laws, Newton's reasoning was that

subject to a centripetal acceleration die to

where Vis the speed of the moon related to the
lume period T by the relation V=2"R, /7. The
time period Tis about 27.3 days and R, was
already known then to be about 2.44. 10m. If
‘we substitute these numbers in Eq (7.3). we get
f value of a, much smaller than the value of
‘acceleration due to gravity gon the surface of
theearth, arfsing also due to earth's gravitational
attraction

‘This clearly shows that the force due to
earth's gravity decreases with distance. If one

to the product of their masses and inversely

(1). The force of attraction between a hollow
spherical shell of uniform density and a
point mass situated outside is just a8 if
the entire mass of the shell is
concentrated at the centre of the shell.
‘Qualltatively this can be understood as
follows: Gravitational forces catised by the
various reglons ofthe shell have components
‘along the line joining the point mass tothe
centre as well as along a direction
prependicular to this line. The components,
prependicular to this line cancel out when
‘Summing over all regions ofthe shell leaving,

this force works out to be as stated above.

2). The force of attraction due to a hollow
spherical shell of uniform density, on a
point mass situated inside it is zero.
(Qualitatively, we ean again understand this
result. Various regons of the spherical shell
attract the point mass inside it in various
‘irections, These forces cancel each other
completely.

17.4 THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT

“The value of the gravitational constant G entering
the Universal law of gravitation can be
determined experimentally and this was first done
by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.
‘The apparatus used by him ts schematically

‘The bar AB has two small lead spheres
attached at its ends. The bar is suspended from

Spheres are brought close to the small ones but

‘opposite force as shawn. There is no het force

7.8 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF
THE EARTH

‘The earth can be imagined to be a sphere made
of a lange number of concentric spherical shells
‘with the smallest one at the centre and the
largest one at its surface. A point outside the
earth Is obviously outside all the shells. Thus,

all the shells exert a gravitational force at the
point outside just as If their masses are
concentrated at their common centre according
to the result stated in section 7.2. The total mass
ofall the shells combined is just the mass of the
earth. Hence, at a point outside the earth, the
gravitational force ts just as fits entire mass of
the earth is concentrated at its centre.

Fora point inside the earth, the situation
fs diferent. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.7

7.6 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY BELOW
‘AND ABOVE THE SURFACE OF EARTH

Consider a point mass mata height habove the
surface of the earth as shown in Fig. 7.8(a). The

Now, consider a point mass mat a depth

So that its distance from the centre of the
earth is (Rd) as shown in the figure. The
earth can be thought of as being composed
of a smaller sphere of radius (Rd) and a
spherical shell of thickness d. The force on

2.7 GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY

We had discussed earlier the notion of potential
energy as being the energy stored in the body at
its qlven position. Ifthe position of the particle
changes on account of forces acting om it, then
the change in its potential energy ts just the
‘amount of work dome on the body by te force.
‘As we had discussed earlier. forces for which the
work done is independent of the path are the
‘conservative forces

“The force of gravity is a conservative force
and we can calculate the potential enemgy of a
body arising out of this force, called the
gravitational potential energy. Consider points

close to the surface of earth, at distances from
the surface much smaller than the radius of the
arth, In such cases, the force of gravity
practically a constant equal to mg, directed
towards the centre ofthe earth, Ifwe consider a
point ata height fy fom the surface of the earth
and another point vertically above tat a height
fh, from the surface, the work done in iting the
particle of mass m from the first to the second
position is denoted by W,,

W,, = Force X displacement

= mg (hy ~ 14) (720)
Ifwe associate a potential energy WIN) at a
point at a height above the surface such that

Wh) = mgh + W, 720
(where W, = constant)
then itis clear that

W,,= Wh) ~ Why) (722)

“The work done in moving the particle is just
the alference of potential energy between its
final and initial positions Observe that the
constant W, cancels out in Bq. (7.22). Setting ft

‘in the last equation, we get. W(h=0)= W,
‘= Omeans points on the surface ofthe earth
‘Thus, W, Is the potential energy on the surface
of the earth.

I we consider points at arbitrary distance
from the surface of the earth, the result just,
derived is not valid since the assumption that
the gravitational force mg is a constant is no
Tonger valid. However, from our discussion we
now that a point outside the earth, the force of
gravitation on a particle directed towards the
centre of the earth is

where M, = mass of earth, m= mass of the

1m place of Eq, (7.21). we can thus associate
4 potential energy Wi ata distance r such that

valid for r> R.

So that once again W,, = Wir) - Wir)
Setting r= infinity inthe last equation, we get
W(r=Infinty)= W,. Thus, W, Is the potential
energy at infinity. One should note that only the
diilerence of potential energy between two points
hhas a definite meaning irom Eqs. (7.22) and
(7-24), One conventionally sets W, equal to zero,
so that the potential energy at a point is just the
amount of work done in displacing the particle
from infinity to that point.

‘We have calculated the potential energy at
4 point of a particle due to gravitational forces
fn it duc to the earth and ft is proportional to
the mass of the particle. The gravitational
potential duc to the gravitational force of the
earth is defined as the potential energy of a
particle of unit mass at that point. From the
earlier discussion, we learn thatthe gravitational
potential energy associated with two particles

It should be noted that an isolated system af

7.9 EARTH SATELLITES

Earth satellites are objects which revolve around
the earth, Their motion is very similar to the
‘motion of planets around the Sun and hence
Kepler's laws of planetary motion are equally
applicable to them. In particular, thelr orbits
‘around the earth arecircilar or elipie. Moon is
the only natural satelite ofthe earth with a near

27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the
rotational period ofthe moon about its own axis
