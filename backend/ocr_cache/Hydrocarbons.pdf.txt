Hydrocarbons are the important sources of energy.

The term ‘hydrocarbon’ is self-explanatory which means
compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons
play a key role in our daily life. You must be familiar
with the terms ‘LPG’ and ‘CNG’ used as fuels. LPG is the
abbreviated form of liquified petroleum gas whereas CNG
stands for compressed natural gas. Another term ‘LNG’
(liquified natural gas) is also in news these days. This is
also a fuel and is obtained by liquifaction of natural gas.
Petrol, diesel and kerosene oil are obtained by the fractional
distillation of petroleum found under the earth’s crust.
Coal gas is obtained by the destructive distillation of
coal. Natural gas is found in upper strata during drilling
of oil wells. The gas after compression is known as
compressed natural gas. LPG is used as a domestic fuel
with the least pollution. Kerosene oil is also used as a
domestic fuel but it causes some pollution. Automobiles
need fuels like petrol, diesel and CNG. Petrol and CNG
operated automobiles cause less pollution. All these fuels
contain mixture of hydrocarbons, which are sources of
energy. Hydrocarbons are also used for the manufacture
of polymers like polythene, polypropene, polystyrene etc.
Higher hydrocarbons are used as solvents for paints. They
are also used as the starting materials for manufacture
of many dyes and drugs. Thus, you can well understand
the importance of hydrocarbons in your daily life. In this
unit, you will learn more about hydrocarbons.

9.1 CLASSIFICATION

Hydrocarbons are of different types. Depending upon
the types of carbon-carbon bonds present, they can
be classified into three main categories - (i) saturated

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 9.indd 296

296

(ii) unsaturated and (iii) aromatic
hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons
contain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen
single bonds. If different carbon atoms are
joined together to form open chain of carbon
atoms with single bonds, they are termed
as alkanes as you have already studied in
Unit 8. On the other hand, if carbon atoms
form a closed chain or a ring, they are termed
as cycloalkanes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds -
double bonds, triple bonds or both. Aromatic
hydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic
compounds. You can construct a large
number of models of such molecules of both
types (open chain and close chain) keeping
in mind that carbon is tetravalent and
hydrogen is monovalent. For making models
of alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds
and plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes,
alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring
models can be constructed.

9.2 ALKANES

As already mentioned, alkanes are saturated
open chain hydrocarbons containing
carbon - carbon single bonds. Methane (CH,)
is the first member of this family. Methane is
a gas found in coal mines and marshy places.
If you replace one hydrogen atom of methane
by carbon and join the required number of
hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of the
other carbon atom, what do you get? You
get C,H,. This hydrocarbon with molecular
formula C,H, is known as ethane. Thus you
can consider C,H, as derived from CH, by
replacing one hydrogen atom by -CH, group.
Go on constructing alkanes by doing this
theoretical exercise i.e., replacing hydrogen
atom by -CH, group. The next molecules will
be C.Hg, C,H)...

These hydrocarbons are inert under
normal conditions as they do not react with
acids, bases and other reagents. Hence,
they were earlier known as paraffins (latin :
parum, little; affinis, affinity). Can you think

CHEMISTRY

of the general formula for alkane family
or homologous series? If we examine the
formula of different alkanes we find that
the general formula for alkanes is C,H,,,,.It
represents any particular homologue when n
is given appropriate value. Can you recall the
structure of methane? According to VSEPR
theory (Unit 4), methane has a tetrahedral
structure (Fig. 9.1), in which carbon atom lies
at the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie
at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron.
All H-C-H bond angles are of 109.5.

H

H
Fig. 9.1 Structure of methane

In alkanes, tetrahedra are joined together
in which C-C and C-H bond lengths are
154 pm and 112 pm respectively (Unit 8).
You have already read that C-C and C-H o
bonds are formed by head-on overlapping of
sp” hybrid orbitals of carbon and 1s orbitals
of hydrogen atoms.

9.2.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism

You have already read about nomenclature
of different classes of organic compounds
in Unit 8. Nomenclature and isomerism
in alkanes can further be understood with
the help of a few more examples. Common
names are given in parenthesis. First three
alkanes - methane, ethane and propane have
only one structure but higher alkanes can
have more than one structure. Let us write
structures for C,H,,. Four carbon atoms of
C,H,, can be joined either in a continuous
chain or with a branched chain in the
following two ways :

Structures I and II possess same molecular
formula but differ in their boiling points and
other properties. Similarly structures III, IV
and V possess the same molecular formula
but have different properties. Structures I and
II are isomers of butane, whereas structures
Ill, IV and V are isomers of pentane. Since
difference in properties is due to difference in
their structures, they are known as structural

297

isomers. It is also clear that structures I and
Il] have continuous chain of carbon atoms
but structures II, IV and V have a branched
chain. Such structural isomers which differ
in chain of carbon atoms are known as chain
isomers. Thus, you have seen that C,H,,
and C,H,, have two and three chain isomers
respectively.

Based upon the number of carbon atoms
attached to a carbon atom, the carbon atom is
termed as primary (1 ), secondary (2 ), tertiary
(3 ) or quaternary (4 ). Carbon atom attached
to no other carbon atom as in methane or to
only one carbon atom as in ethane is called
primary carbon atom. Terminal carbon
atoms are always primary. Carbon atom
attached to two carbon atoms is known as
secondary. Tertiary carbon is attached to
three carbon atoms and neo or quaternary
carbon is attached to four carbon atoms. Can
you identify 1, 2,3 and4 carbon atoms in

structures I to V ? If you go on constructing
structures for higher alkanes, you will be
getting still larger number of isomers. C,H,,
has got five isomers and C,H,, has nine. As
many as 75 isomers are possible for C,)Hyp.

In structures II, IV and V, you observed
that -CH, group is attached to carbon atom
numbered as 2. You will come across groups
like -CH,, -C,H,, -—C,H, etc. attached to
carbon atoms in alkanes or other classes of

CHEMISTRY

compounds. These groups or substituents
are known as alkyl groups as they are derived
from alkanes by removal of one hydrogen
atom. General formula for alkyl groups is
C,,H,4, (Unit 8).

Let us recall the general rules for
nomenclature already discussed in Unit 8.
Nomenclature of substituted alkanes can
further be understood by considering the
following problem:

Write structures of different isomeric alkyl groups corresponding to the molecular formula
C,H,,. Write IUPAC names of alcohols obtained by attachment of —-OH groups at different

Then after numbering it, the substituents are

finally valence of each carbon atom is satisfied
by putting the correct number of hydrogen
atoms. This can be clarified by writing the
structure of 3-ethyl-2, 2-dimethylpentane in
the following steps :

i) Draw the chain of five carbon atoms:
C-C-C-C-C

ii) Give number to carbon atoms:

9.2.2 Preparation

Petroleum and natural gas are the main
sources of alkanes. However, alkanes can be
prepared by following methods :

1. From unsaturated hydrocarbons
Dihydrogen gas adds to alkenes and alkynes
in the presence of finely divided catalysts like
platinum, palladium or nickel to form alkanes.
This process is called hydrogenation. These
metals adsorb dihydrogen gas on their
surfaces and activate the hydrogen — hydrogen
bond. Platinum and palladium catalyse the
reaction at room temperature but relatively
higher temperature and pressure are required
with nickel catalysts.

known as decarboxylation.

9.2.3, Properties
Physical properties

Alkanes are almost non-polar molecules
because of the covalent nature of C-C and
C-H bonds and due to very little difference
of electronegativity between carbon and
hydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der
Waals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first
four members, C, to C, are gases, C, to C,,
are liquids and those containing 18 carbon
atoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are
colourless and odourless. What do you think
about solubility of alkanes in water based
upon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol
is a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used
as a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower
fractions of petroleum are also used for dry
cleaning of clothes to remove grease stains.
On the basis of this observation, what do
you think about the nature of the greasy
substance? You are correct if you say that
grease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non-

Reprint 2025-26

302

polar and, hence, hydrophobic in nature. It is
generally observed that in relation to solubility
of substances in solvents, polar substances
are soluble in polar solvents, whereas the
non-polar ones in non-polar solvents Le., like
dissolves like.

Boiling point (b.p.) of different alkanes are
given in Table 9.2 from which it is clear that
there is a steady increase in boiling point with
increase in molecular mass. This is due to the
fact that the intermolecular van der Waals
forces increase with increase of the molecular
size or the surface area of the molecule.

You can make an interesting observation
by having a look on the boiling points of
three isomeric pentanes viz., (pentane,
2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane). It
is observed (Table 9.2) that pentane having
a continuous chain of five carbon atoms has
the highest boiling point (309.1K) whereas
2,2 — dimethylpropane boils at 282.5K. With
increase in number of branched chains,
the molecule attains the shape of a sphere.
This results in smaller area of contact and
therefore weak intermolecular forces between
spherical molecules, which are overcome at
relatively lower temperatures.

Chemical properties
As already mentioned, alkanes are generally
inert towards acids, bases, oxidising and

CHEMISTRY

reducing agents. However, they undergo
the following reactions under certain
conditions.

1. Substitution reactions

One or more hydrogen atoms of alkanes
can be replaced by halogens, nitro group
and sulphonic acid group. Halogenation
takes place either at higher temperature
(573-773 K) or in the presence of diffused
sunlight or ultraviolet light. Lower alkanes
do not undergo nitration and sulphonation
reactions. These reactions in which hydrogen
atoms of alkanes are substituted are known
as substitution reactions. AS an example,
chlorination of methane is given below:

It is found that the rate of reaction of
alkanes with halogens is F, > Cl, > Br, > I,.
Rate ofreplacement of hydrogens of alkanesis:
3 >2 > 1. Fluorination is too violent to
be controlled. Iodination is very slow and a
reversible reaction. It can be carried out in the
presence of oxidizing agents like HIO, or HNO,.

CH, +1, = CH,I+HI (9.15)

HIO,+5HI>31,+3H,O (9.16)

Halogenation is supposed to proceed via
free radical chain mechanism involving three
steps namely initiation, propagation and
termination as given below:

Mechanism

(i) Initiation : The reaction is initiated
by homolysis of chlorine molecule in the
presence of light or heat. The Cl-Cl bond
is weaker than the C-C and C-H bond and
hence, is easiest to break.

C1-Cl ——’_,CH,+ Cl
OMOLYSIS

Chlorine free radicals

(ii) Propagation : Chlorine free radical
attacks the methane molecule and takes the
reaction in the forward direction by breaking
the C-H bond to generate methy] free radical
with the formation of H-Cl.

(a) CH,+ C1 —” >4CH,+HCl

The methyl radical thus obtained attacks
the second molecule of chlorine to form
CH,,— Cl with the liberation of another chlorine
free radical by homolysis of chlorine molecule.

(b) CH, + C1-C1 —™ > CH,-C1+Cl

The chlorine and methyl free radicals
generated above repeat steps (a) and (b)
respectively and thereby setup a chain of
reactions. The propagation steps (a) and
(b) are those which directly give principal
products, but many other propagation

303

steps are possible and may occur. Two such
steps given below explain how more highly
haloginated products are formed.

CH,C1 + Cl > CH,C1 + HCl
CH,C1 + C1-C1>CH,Cl, +C€l

(iii) Termination: The reaction stops after
some time due to consumption of reactants
and / or due to the following side reactions :

The possible chain terminating steps are:
(a) C1+ Cl >C1-Cl
(b) H, C + CH, > H,C- CH,
() H,Cl + Cl > H,C-Cl

Though in (c), CH, - Cl, the one of the
products is formed but free radicals are
consumed and the chain is terminated. The
above mechanism helps us to understand

the reason for the formation of ethane asa
byproduct during chlorination of methane.

2. Combustion
Alkanes on heating in the presence of air or
dioxygen are completely oxidized to carbon
dioxide and water with the evolution of large
amount of heat.

C,H,0(g) + 13/20,(g) > 4CO,(g) + SH,O(1)
A.H® = -2875.84kJ mol
(9.18)

The general combustion equation for any
alkane is :

3n+1
C.H,,.5 + (ea) O, > nCO, + (n+1)H,O
(9.19)
Due to the evolution of large amount of
heat during combustion, alkanes are used as
fuels.

During incomplete combustion of alkanes
with insufficient amount of air or dioxygen,
carbon black is formed which is used in
the manufacture of ink, printer ink, black
pigments and as filters.

7. Pyrolysis

Higher alkanes on heating to higher
temperature decompose into lower alkanes,
alkenes etc. Such a decomposition reaction

Pyrolysis of alkanes is believed to be a

or petrol gas from kerosene oil or petrol
involves the principle of pyrolysis. For
example, dodecane, a constituent of kerosene

platinum, palladium or nickel gives a mixture
of heptane and pentene.

9.2.4 Conformations

Alkanes contain carbon-carbon sigma (o)
bonds. Electron distribution of the sigma
molecular orbital is symmetrical around the
internuclear axis of the C-C bond which is
not disturbed due to rotation about its axis.
This permits free rotation about C-C single
bond. This rotation results into different
spatial arrangements of atoms in space
which can change into one another. Such
spatial arrangements of atoms which can
be converted into one another by rotation
around a C-C single bond are called
conformations or conformers or rotamers.
Alkanes can thus have infinite number of
conformations by rotation around C-C single
bonds. However, it may be remembered that
rotation around a C-C single bond is not
completely free. It is hindered by a small
energy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol due to weak
repulsive interaction between the adjacent
bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction
is called torsional strain.

Conformations of ethane : Ethane
molecule (C,H,) contains a carbon — carbon
single bond with each carbon atom attached
to three hydrogen atoms. Considering the
ball and stick model of ethane, keep one
carbon atom stationary and rotate the other
carbon atom around the C-C axis. This
rotation results into infinite number of spatial
arrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to
one carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen
atoms attached to the other carbon atom.
These are called conformational isomers
(conformers). Thus there are infinite number
of conformations of ethane. However, there are
two extreme cases. One such conformation
in which hydrogen atoms attached to two
carbons are as closed together as possible is
called eclipsed conformation and the other in
which hydrogens are as far apart as possible
is known as the staggered conformation. Any
other intermediate conformation is called a
skew conformation.It may be remembered
that in all the conformations, the bond angles
and the bond lengths remain the same.
Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can
be represented by Sawhorse and Newman
projections.

1. Sawhorse projections

In this projection, the molecule is viewed
along the molecular axis. It is then projected
on paper by drawing the central C-C bond
as a somewhat longer straight line. Upper
end of the line is slightly tilted towards
right or left hand side. The front carbon is
shown at the lower end of the line, whereas
the rear carbon is shown at the upper end.
Each carbon has three lines attached to it
corresponding to three hydrogen atoms.
The lines are inclined at an angle of 120 to
each other. Sawhorse projections of eclipsed
and staggered conformations of ethane are
depicted in Fig. 9.2.

represented by a circle and the three hydrogen
atoms are shown attached to it by the shorter
lines drawn at an angle of 120 to each other.

Relative stability of conformations: As
mentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane,
the electron clouds of carbon-hydrogen bonds
are as far apart as possible. Thus, there are
minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy
and maximum stability of the molecule. On the
other hand, when the staggered form changes
into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the
carbon — hydrogen bonds come closer to each
other resulting in increase in electron cloud
repulsions. To check the increased repulsive
forces, molecule will have to possess more
energy and thus has lesser stability. As already
mentioned, the repulsive interaction between
the electron clouds, which affects stability of
a conformation, is called torsional strain.
Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon
the angle of rotation about C-C bond. This
angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional
angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the
staggered form has the least torsional strain
and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional
strain. Therefore, staggered conformation is
more stable than the eclipsed conformation.
Hence, molecule largely remains in staggered
conformation or we can say that it is preferred
conformation. Thus it may be inferred that
rotation around C-C bond in ethane is not
completely free. The energy difference between
the two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5
kJ mol |, which is very small. Even at ordinary
temperatures, the ethane molecule gains
thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to
overcome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol”
through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it
can be said that rotation about carbon-carbon
single bond in ethane is almost free for all
practical purposes. It has not been possible to
separate and isolate different conformational
isomers of ethane.

9.3 ALKENES

Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons
containing at least one double bond. What
should be the general formula of alkenes? If
there is one double bond between two carbon
atoms in alkenes, they must possess two
hydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence,
general formula for alkenes is C,H,,,. Alkenes
are also known as olefins (oil forming) since

CHEMISTRY

the first member, ethylene or ethene (C,H,)
was found to form an oily liquid on reaction
with chlorine.

9.3.1 Structure of Double Bond

Carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes
consists of one strong sigma (o) bond (bond
enthalpy about 397 kJ mol’) due to head-on
overlapping of sp hybridised orbitals and
one weak pi (x) bond (bond enthalpy about
284 kJ mol ') obtained by lateral or sideways
overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two
carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in
bond length (134 pm) than the C-C single
bond (154 pm). You have already read that
the pi (mt) bond is a weaker bond due to poor
sideways overlapping between the two 2p
orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (m) bond
makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely
held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are
easily attacked by reagents or compounds
which are in search of electrons. Such
reagents are called electrophilic reagents.
The presence of weaker m-bond makes alkenes
unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes
and thus, alkenes can be changed into single
bond compounds by combining with the
electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double
bond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol 5 is greater
than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in
ethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol . Orbital
diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in

of alkanes. It may be remembered that first
member of alkene series is: CH, (replacing
n by 1 in C,H,,) known as methene but has
a very short life. As already mentioned, first
stable member of alkene series is C,H, known
as ethylene (common) or ethene (IUPAC).

9.3.3 Isomerism

Alkenes show both structural isomerism and
geometrical isomerism.

Structural isomerism : As in alkanes, ethene
(C,H,) and propene (C,H,) can have only one
structure but alkenes higher than propene
have different structures. Alkenes possessing
C,H, as molecular formula can be written in
the following three ways:

2-Methylprop-1-ene
(C,H)
Structures I and II, and II and III are
the examples of chain isomerism whereas
structures I and II are position isomers.

Geometrical isomerism: Doubly bonded
carbon atoms have to satisfy the remaining
two valences by joining with two atoms or
groups. If the two atoms or groups attached
to each carbon atom are different, they can
be represented by YX C = C XY like structure.
YX C = C XY can be represented in space in
the following two ways :

\ ~ aN y
C C
I II
C

x’ \y vy’ x
(a) (b)

CHEMISTRY

In (a), the two identical atoms ie., both
the X or both the Y lie on the same side
of the double bond but in (b) the two X or
two Y lie across the double bond or on the
opposite sides of the double bond. This
results in different geometry of (a) and (b) i.e.
disposition of atoms or groups in space in
the two arrangements is different. Therefore,
they are stereoisomers. They would have the
same geometry if atoms or groups around
C=C bond can be rotated but rotation around
C=C bond is not free. It is restricted. For
understanding this concept, take two pieces
of strong cardboards and join them with the
help of two nails. Hold one cardboard in your
one hand and try to rotate the other. Can
you really rotate the other cardboard ? The
answer is no. The rotation is restricted. This
illustrates that the restricted rotation of atoms
or groups around the doubly bonded carbon
atoms gives rise to different geometries of
such compounds. The stereoisomers of this
type are called geometrical isomers. The
isomer of the type (a), in which two identical
atoms or groups lie on the same side of the
double bond is called cis isomer and the
other isomer of the type (b), in which identical
atoms or groups lie on the opposite sides of
the double bond is called trans isomer . Thus
cis and trans isomers have the same structure
but have different configuration (arrangement
of atoms or groups in space). Due to different
arrangement of atoms or groups in space,
these isomers differ in their properties like
melting point, boiling point, dipole moment,
solubility etc. Geometrical or cis-trans isomers
of but-2-ene are represented below :

(b.p. 277 K) (b.p. 274 K)

Cis form of alkene is found to be more
polar than the trans form. For example,
dipole moment of cis-but-2-ene is 0.33 Debye,
whereas, dipole moment of the trans form
is almost zero or it can be said that

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 9.indd 309

HYDROCARBONS

trans-but-2-ene is non-polar. This can be
understood by drawing geometries of the two
forms as given below from which it is clear
that in the trans-but-2-ene, the two methyl
groups are in opposite directions, Threfore,
dipole moments of C-CH, bonds cancel, thus
making the trans form non-polar.

9.3.4 Preparation

1. From alkynes: Alkynes on partial
reduction with calculated amount of
dihydrogen in the presence of palladised
charcoal partially deactivated with poisons
like sulphur compounds or quinoline give
alkenes. Partially deactivated palladised
charcoal is known as Lindlar’s catalyst.
Alkenes thus obtained are having cis
geometry. However, alkynes on reduction
with sodium in liquid ammonia form trans
alkenes.

ethanol) eliminate one molecule of halogen
acid to form alkenes. This reaction is
known as dehydrohalogenation i.e.,
removal of halogen acid. This is example
of B-elimination reaction, since hydrogen
atom is eliminated from the B carbon atom
(carbon atom next to the carbon to which
halogen is attached).

Nature of halogen atom and the alkyl group
determine rate of the reaction. It is observed
that for halogens, the rate is: iodine >
bromine > chlorine, while for alkyl groups
it is : tertiary > secondary > primary.

3. From vicinal dihalides: Dihalides in
which two halogen atoms are attached
to two adjacent carbon atoms are known
as vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides on
treatment with zinc metal lose a molecule
of ZnX, to form an alkene. This reaction
is known as dehalogenation.

4. From alcohols by acidic dehydration:
You have read during nomenclature of
different homologous series in Unit 12
that alcohols are the hydroxy derivatives
of alkanes. They are represented by R-OH
where, R is C,H,,,,,. Alcohols on heating
with concentrated sulphuric acid form
alkenes with the elimination of one water
molecule. Since a water molecule is
eliminated from the alcohol molecule in
the presence of an acid, this reaction is
known as acidic dehydration of alcohols.
This reaction is also the example of
B-elimination reaction since -OH group

9.3.5 Properties

Physical properties

Alkenes as a class resemble alkanes in
physical properties, except in types of
isomerism and difference in polar nature.
The first three members are gases, the next
fourteen are liquids and the higher ones are
solids. Ethene is a colourless gas with a faint
sweet smell. All other alkenes are colourless
and odourless, insoluble in water but fairly
soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene,
petroleum ether. They show a regular increase
in boiling point with increase in size ie., every
— CH, group added increases boiling point by
20-30 K. Like alkanes, straight chain alkenes
have higher boiling point than isomeric
branched chain compounds.

Chemical properties

Alkenes are the rich source of loosely held
pi (x) electrons, due to which they show
addition reactions in which the electrophiles
add on to the carbon-carbon double bond to
form the addition products. Some reagents
also add by free radical mechanism. There
are cases when under special conditions,
alkenes also undergo free radical substitution
reactions. Oxidation and ozonolysis reactions
are also quite prominent in alkenes. A brief
description of different reactions of alkenes
is given below:

1. Addition of dihydrogen: Alkenes add
up one molecule of dihydrogen gas in
the presence of finely divided nickel,
palladium or platinum to form alkanes
(Section 9.2.2)

2. Addition of halogens : Halogens like
bromine or chlorine add up to alkene to
form vicinal dihalides. However, iodine
does not show addition reaction under

normal conditions. The reddish orange
colour of bromine solution in carbon
tetrachloride is discharged when bromine
adds up to an unsaturation site. This
reaction is used as a test for unsaturation.
Addition of halogens to alkenes is an
example of electrophilic addition reaction
involving cyclic halonium ion formation
which you will study in higher classes.

3. Addition of hydrogen halides: Hydrogen
halides (HCl, HBr,HI) add up to alkenes
to form alkyl halides. The order of
reactivity of the hydrogen halides is
HI > HBr > HCl. Like addition of halogens
to alkenes, addition of hydrogen halides is
also an example of electrophilic addition
reaction. Let us illustrate this by taking
addition of HBr to symmetrical and
unsymmetrical alkenes

Addition reaction of HBr to symmetrical

Addition reactions of HBr to symmetrical
alkenes (similar groups attached to double
bond) take place by electrophilic addition
mechanism.

Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a
generalisation in 1869 after studying such
reactions in detail. These generalisations
led Markovnikov to frame a rule called
Markovnikov rule. The rule states that
negative part of the addendum (adding
molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom
which possesses lesser number of hydrogen
atoms. Thus according to this rule, product
I ie., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual
practice, this is the principal product of the
reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov
rule can be better understood in terms of
mechanism of the reaction.

Mechanism

Hydrogen bromide provides an electrophile,
H’, which attacks the double bond to form
carbocation as shown below :

because it is formed at a faster rate.

Anti Markovnikov addition or peroxide
effect or Kharash effect

In the presence of peroxide, addition of HBr
to unsymmetrical alkenes like propene takes
place contrary to the Markovnikov rule. This
happens only with HBr but not with HCl
and Hl. This addition reaction was observed
by M.S. Kharash and F.R. Mayo in 1933
at the University of Chicago. This reaction
is known as peroxide or Kharash effect
or addition reaction anti to Markovnikov
rule.

The secondary free radical obtained in the
above mechanism (step iii) is more stable than
the primary. This explains the formation of
1-bromopropane as the major product. It may
be noted that the peroxide effect is not observed
in addition of HCl and HI. This may be due
to the fact that the H-Cl bond being
stronger (430.5 kJ mol’) than H-Br bond
(363.7 kJ mol), is not cleaved by the free
radical, whereas the H-I bond is weaker
(296.8 kJ mol’) and iodine free radicals
combine to form iodine molecules instead of
adding to the double bond.

4. Addition of sulphuric acid : Cold
concentrated sulphuric acid adds to
alkenes in accordance with Markovnikov
rule to form alkyl hydrogen sulphate by
the electrophilic addition reaction.

plastic buckets and other moulded articles.

Though these materials have now become

common, excessive use of polythene and

polypropylene is a matter of great concern for
all of us.

9.4 ALKYNES

Like alkenes, alkynes are also unsaturated
hydrocarbons. They contain at least one triple
bond between two carbon atoms. The number
of hydrogen atoms is still less in alkynes as
compared to alkenes or alkanes. Their general
formula is C,H,,, »-

The first stable member of alkyne series
is ethyne which is popularly known as
acetylene. Acetylene is used for arc welding
purposes in the form of oxyacetylene flame
obtained by mixing acetylene with oxygen
gas. Alkynes are starting materials for a large
number of organic compounds. Hence, it
is interesting to study this class of organic
compounds.

9.4.1

In common system, alkynes are named as
derivatives of acetylene. In IUPAC system, they

Nomenclature and Isomerism

The position of the triple bond is indicated

You have already learnt that ethyne and

there are two possible structures for butyne —

are known as position isomers. In how

9.4.2 Structure of Triple Bond

Ethyne is the simplest molecule of alkyne
series. Structure of ethyne is shown in
Fig. 9.6.

Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp
hybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (0)
bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping
of the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two
carbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised
orbital of each carbon atom undergoes
overlapping along the internuclear axis with
the 1s orbital of each of the two hydrogen
atoms forming two C-H sigma bonds.
H-C-C bond angle is of 180. Each carbon
has two unhybridised p orbitals which are
perpendicular to each other as well as to the
plane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals
of one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p

orbitals of the other carbon atom, which
undergo lateral or sideways overlapping to
form two pi (x) bonds between two carbon
atoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one
C-C o bond, two C-H o bonds and two C-C
m bonds. The strength of C=C bond (bond
enthalpy 823 kJ mol’) is more than those
of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol’)
and C-C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol’).
The C=C bond length is shorter (120 pm)
than those of C=C (133 pm) and C-C (154
pm). Electron cloud between two carbon
atoms is cylindrically symmetrical about the
internuclear axis. Thus, ethyne is a linear
molecule.

9.4.3 Preparation

1. From calcium carbide: On industrial
scale, ethyne is prepared by treating
calcium carbide with water. Calcium
carbide is prepared by heating quick lime
with coke. Quick lime can be obtained by
heating limestone as shown in the following

9.4.4 Properties

Physical properties

Physical properties of alkynes follow the same
trend of alkenes and alkanes. First three
members are gases, the next eight are liquids
and the higher ones are solids. All alkynes
are colourless. Ethyene has characteristic
odour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes
are weakly polar in nature. They are lighter
than water and immiscible with water but
soluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon
tetrachloride and benzene. Their melting
point, boiling point and density increase with
increase in molar mass.

Chemical properties
Alkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions
and polymerisation reactions as follows :

A. Acidic character of alkyne: Sodium
metal and sodamide (NaNH.,) are strong
bases. They react with ethyne to form sodium
acetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen
gas. These reactions have not been observed
in case of ethene and ethane thus indicating
that ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison
to ethene and ethane. Why is it so ? Has
it something to do with their structures
and the hybridisation ? You have read that
hydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to

CHEMISTRY

the sp hybridised carbon atoms whereas
they are attached to sp’ hybridised carbon
atoms in ethene and sp’ hybridised carbons
in ethane. Due to the maximum percentage of
s character (50%), the sp hybridised orbitals
of carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have
highest electronegativity; hence, these attract
the shared electron pair of the C-H bond of
ethyne to a greater extent than that of the
sp’ hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene
and the sp” hybridised orbital of carbon in
ethane. Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms
can be liberated as protons more easily as
compared to ethene and ethane. Hence,
hydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply
bonded carbon atom are acidic in nature. You
may note that the hydrogen atoms attached
to the triply bonded carbons are acidic but
not all the hydrogen atoms of alkynes.

These reactions are not shown by alkenes

about the above reactions with but-1-yne and
but-2-yne ? Alkanes, alkenes and alkynes
follow the following trend in their acidic
behaviour :

i) CH=CH >H,C -CH, > CH,-CH,
ii) HC =CH > CH, -C= CH >> CH,-C=C-CH,

B. Addition reactions: Alkynes contain a
triple bond, so they add up, two molecules of
dihydrogen, halogen, hydrogen halides etc.
Formation of the addition product takes place
according to the following steps.

but in a majority of reactions of aromatic
compounds, the unsaturation of benzene ring
is retained. However, there are examples of
aromatic hydrocarbons which do not contain a
benzene ring but instead contain other highly
unsaturated ring. Aromatic compounds
containing benzene ring are known as
benzenoids and those not containing a
benzene ring are known as non-benzenoids.
Some examples of arenes are given

9.5.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism

The nomenclature and isomerism of aromatic
hydrocarbons has already been discussed in
Unit 8. All six hydrogen atoms in benzene
are equivalent; so it forms one and only one
type of monosubstituted product. When two
hydrogen atoms in benzene are replaced by
two similar or different monovalent atoms or
groups, three different position isomers are
possible. The 1, 2 or 1, 6 is known as the ortho
(o-), the 1, 3 or 1, 5 as meta (m-) and the 1,
4 as para (p-) disubstituted compounds. A

Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in
Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He
made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that
carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found
an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that
these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural formula to
benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described

319

the discovery of benzene structure later as:

“I was sitting writing at my textbook, but the work did not progress; my thoughts
were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire, and dozed. Again the atoms were
gambolling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the
background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this

kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformations; long

rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What

was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my

eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of

the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us

beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).

One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds

having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.

9.5.2 Structure of Benzene

Benzene was isolated by Michael Faraday
in 1825. The molecular formula of benzene,
C,H,, indicates a high degree of unsaturation.
This molecular formula did not account for
its relationship to corresponding alkanes,
alkenes and alkynes which you have studied
in earlier sections of this unit. What do you
think about its possible structure? Due to
its unique properties and unusual stability,
it took several years to assign its structure.
Benzene was found to be a stable molecule
and found to form a triozonide which indicates
the presence of three double bonds. Benzene

was further found to produce one and only one
monosubstituted derivative which indicated
that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms
of benzene are identical. On the basis of this
observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed
the following structure for benzene having
cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with
alternate single and double bonds and one
hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.

The Kekulé structure indicates
the possibility of two isomeric
1, 2-dibromobenzenes. In one of the isomers,
the bromine atoms are attached to the
doubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the
other, they are attached to the singly bonded
carbons.

However, benzene was found to form only
one ortho disubstituted product. This problem
was overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the
concept of oscillating nature of double bonds
in benzene as given below.

—_—==

Even with this modification, Kekulé
structure of benzene fails to explain unusual
stability and preference to substitution
reactions than addition reactions, which
could later on be explained by resonance.

Resonance and stability of benzene

According to Valence Bond Theory, the
concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene
is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a
hybrid of various resonating structures. The
two structures, A and B given by Kekulé are
the main contributing structures. The hybrid
structure is represented by inserting a circle
or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown
in (C). The circle represents the six electrons
which are delocalised between the six carbon
atoms of the benzene ring.

O-O-O- 6

(A)

The orbital overlapping gives us better
picture about the structure of benzene. All
the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp”
hybridized. Two sp hybrid orbitals of each
carbon atom overlap with sp’ hybrid orbitals
of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C—C
sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal
plane. The remaining sp hybrid orbital of
each carbon atom overlaps with s orbital
of a hydrogen atom to form six C—H sigma
bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one

CHEMISTRY

unhybridised p orbital perpendicular to the
plane of the ring as shown below:

The unhybridised p orbital of carbon atoms
are close enough to form a zm bond by lateral
overlap. There are two equal possibilities of
forming three x bonds by overlap of p orbitals
of C, -C,, C, — C,, C, - Cg or C, — Cy, C, - Cz,
C, — C, respectively as shown in the following
figures.

Structures shown in Fig. 9.7(a) and (b)

between all the carbon atoms in the ring has
been determined by the X-ray diffraction to
be the same; there is equal probability for the
p orbital of each carbon atom to overlap with
the p orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms [Fig.
9.7 (c)]. This can be represented in the form
of two doughtnuts (rings) of electron clouds
[Fig. 9.7 (d)], one above and one below the
plane of the hexagonal ring as shown below:

or

(electron cloud)

Fig. 9.7 (c)

Fig. 9.7 (d)

The six nm electrons are thus delocalised
and can move freely about the six carbon
nuclei, instead of any two as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised z electron cloud
is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the
carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised
between two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence
of delocalised 1 electrons in benzene makes
it more stable than the hypothetical
cyclohexatriene.

X-Ray diffraction data reveals that benzene
is a planar molecule. Had any one of the above
structures of benzene (A or B) been correct,
two types of C—C bond lengths were expected.
However, X-ray data indicates that all the
six C—C bond lengths are of the same order
(139 pm) which is intermediate between
C— C single bond (154 pm) and C—C double
bond (133 pm). Thus the absence of pure
double bond in benzene accounts for the
reluctance of benzene to show addition
reactions under normal conditions, thus
explaining the unusual behaviour of benzene.

9.5.3 Aromaticity

Benzene was considered as parent ‘aromatic’
compound. Now, the name is applied to all the
ring systems whether or not having benzene
ring, possessing following characteristics.

321

(i) Planarity

(ii) Complete delocalisation of the z electrons
in the ring

(iii) Presence of (4n + 2) x electrons in the ring

Physical properties

Aromatic hydrocarbons are non- polar
molecules and are usually colourless liquids
or solids with a characteristic aroma. You are
also familiar with naphthalene balls which are
used in toilets and for preservation of clothes
because of unique smell of the compound
and the moth repellent property. Aromatic
hydrocarbons are immiscible with water but
are readily miscible with organic solvents.
They burn with sooty flame.

Chemical properties

Arenes are characterised by electrophilic
substitution reactions. However, under
special conditions they can also undergo
addition and oxidation reactions.

Electrophilic substitution reactions

The common electrophilic substitution
reactions of arenes are nitration, halogenation,
sulphonation, Friedel Craft’s alkylation and
acylation reactions in which attacking reagent
is an electrophile (E’)

(i) Nitration: A nitro group is introduced

and concentrated sulphuric acid (nitrating
mixture).

If excess of electrophilic reagent is used,

Mechanism of electrophilic substitution
reactions:

According to experimental evidences, S,, (S =
substitution; E = electrophilic) reactions are
supposed to proceed via the following three
steps:

(a) Generation of the eletrophile
(b) Formation of carbocation intermediate

(c) Removal of proton from the carbocation
intermediate

(a) Generation of electrophile E’: During
chlorination, alkylation and acylation of
benzene, anhydrous AICl,, being a Lewis acid
helps in generation of the elctrophile cl®, R®,
RCO (acylium ion) respectively by combining
with the attacking reagent.

9.5.6 Directive influence of a functional
group in monosubstituted benzene

When monosubstituted benzene is subjected
to further substitution, three possible
disubstituted products are not formed in
equal amounts. Two types of behaviour are
observed. Either ortho and para products or
meta product is predominantly formed. It
has also been observed that this behaviour
depends on the nature of the substituent
already present in the benzene ring and not
on the nature of the entering group. This is
known as directive influence of substituents.
Reasons for ortho/para or meta directive
nature of groups are discussed below:

Ortho and para directing groups: The
groups which direct the incoming group to
ortho and para positions are called ortho and
para directing groups. As an example, let us
discuss the directive influence of phenolic
(-OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of
following structures:

COOH +O-H +O-H

IV V

It is clear from the above resonating
structures that the electron density is more on
o-and p- positions. Hence, the substitution
takes place mainly at these positions. However,
it may be noted that -I effect of- OH group also
operates due to which the electron density on
ortho and para positions of the benzene ring
is slightly reduced. But the overall electron
density increases at these positions of the
ring due to resonance. Therefore, -OH group
activates the benzene ring for the attack by

an electrophile. Other examples of activating
groups are —-NH,, -NHR, -NHCOCH,, -OCH,,
-CH,, -C,H,, etc.

In the case of aryl halides, halogens are
moderately deactivating. Because of their
strong — I effect, overall electron density on
benzene ring decreases. It makes further
substitution difficult. However, due to
resonance the electron density on o- and
p- positions is greater than that at the
m-position. Hence, they are also o- and p-
directing groups. Resonance structures of
chlorobenzene are given below:

Meta directing group: The groups which
direct the incoming group to meta position are
called meta directing groups. Some examples
of meta directing groups are -—NO,, —CN, -CHO,
—COR, -—COOH, -COOR, -SO,H, etc.

Let us take the example of nitro group.
Nitro group reduces the electron density in
the benzene ring due to its strong-I effect.

In this case, the overall electron density
on benzene ring decreases making further
substitution difficult, therefore these groups
are also called ‘deactivating groups’. The
electron density on o- and p- position
is comparatively less than that at meta
position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on
comparatively electron rich meta position
resulting in meta substitution.

9.6 CARCINOGENICITY AND TOXICITY

Benzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons
containing more than two benzene rings
fused together are toxic and said to
possess cancer producing (carcinogenic)
property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons
are formed on incomplete combustion of
organic materials like tobacco, coal and
petroleum. They enter into human body
and undergo various biochemical reactions
and finally damage DNA and cause cancer.
Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are
given below (see box).

326 CHEMISTRY

SUMMARY

Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly
obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals
are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of
commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG (compressed
natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are
obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes)
and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their
structure.

The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation
and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly
electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under
special conditions.

Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C-C sigma
bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation
is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical
(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon-carbon double bond.

Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the
property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure
characterised by Htickel (4n+2)z electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached
to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards
further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of
the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.
