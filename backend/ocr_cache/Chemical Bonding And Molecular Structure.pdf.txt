Scientists are constantly discovering new compounds,
orderly arranging the facts about them, trying to explain
with the existing knowledge, organising to modify the
earlier views or evolve theories for explaining the newly
observed facts.

Matter is made up of one or different type of elements.
Under normal conditions no other element exists as an
independent atom in nature, except noble gases. However,
a group of atoms is found to exist together as one species
having characteristic properties. Such a group of atoms
is called a molecule. Obviously there must be some force
which holds these constituent atoms together in the
molecules. The attractive force which holds various
constituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together in different
chemical species is called a chemical bond. Since the
formation of chemical compounds takes place as a result of
combination of atoms of various elements in different ways,
it raises many questions. Why do atoms combine? Why are
only certain combinations possible? Why do some atoms
combine while certain others do not? Why do molecules
possess definite shapes? To answer such questions different
theories and concepts have been put forward from time
to time. These are Késsel-Lewis approach, Valence Shell
Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory, Valence Bond (VB)
Theory and Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory. The evolution
of various theories of valence and the interpretation of
the nature of chemical bonds have closely been related to
the developments in the understanding of the structure
of atom, the electronic configuration of elements and the
periodic table. Every system tends to be more stable and
bonding is nature’s way of lowering the energy of the system
to attain stability.

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

4.1 KOSSEL-LEWIS APPROACH TO
CHEMICAL BONDING

In order to explain the formation of chemical
bond in terms of electrons, a number of
attempts were made, but it was only in
1916 when Ko6ssel and Lewis succeeded
independently in giving a satisfactory
explanation. They were the first to provide
some logical explanation of valence which was
based on the inertness of noble gases.

Lewis pictured the atom in terms of a
positively charged ‘Kernel’ (the nucleus plus
the inner electrons) and the outer shell that
could accommodate a maximum of eight
electrons. He, further assumed that these
eight electrons occupy the corners of a cube
which surround the ‘Kernel’. Thus the single
outer shell electron of sodium would occupy
one corner of the cube, while in the case of
a noble gas all the eight corners would be
occupied. This octet of electrons, represents
a particularly stable electronic arrangement.
Lewis postulated that atoms achieve
the stable octet when they are linked by
chemical bonds. In the case of sodium and
chlorine, this can happen by the transfer of
an electron from sodium to chlorine thereby
giving the Na* and CI ions. In the case of
other molecules like Cl,, H,, F,, etc., the bond
is formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons
between the atoms. In the process each atom
attains a stable outer octet of electrons.

Lewis Symbols: In the formation of a
molecule, only the outer shell electrons take
part in chemical combination and they are
known as valence electrons. The inner shell
electrons are well protected and are generally
not involved in the combination process.
G.N. Lewis, an American chemist introduced
simple notations to represent valence electrons
in an atom. These notations are called Lewis
symbols. For example, the Lewis symbols for
the elements of second period are as under:

Li Be «Be °Ce

“Ne 102 Ff Ne?

Significance of Lewis Symbols : The
number of dots around the symbol represents

101

the number of valence electrons. This number
of valence electrons helps to calculate the
common or group valence of the element.
The group valence of the elements is generally
either equal to the number of dots in Lewis
symbols or 8 minus the number of dots or
valence electrons.

Kossel, in relation to chemical bonding,
drew attention to the following facts:

e In the periodic table, the highly
electronegative halogens and the highly
electropositive alkali metals are separated
by the noble gases;

e The formation of a negative ion from a
halogen atom and a positive ion from
an alkali metal atom is associated with
the gain and loss of an electron by the
respective atoms;

e The negative and positive ions thus
formed attain stable noble gas electronic
configurations. The noble gases (with the
exception of helium which has a duplet
of electrons) have a particularly stable
outer shell configuration of eight (octet)
electrons, ns’*np’°.

e The negative and positive ions are stabilized
by electrostatic attraction.

For example, the formation of NaCl from
sodium and chlorine, according to the above
scheme, can be explained as:

Na > Nat + €&

[Ne] 3s? [Ne]

Clt+e = Cl

[Ne] 3s? 3p° [Ne] 3s? 3p° or [Ar]

Na* + Cl 73> NaCl or NatCl

Similarly the formation of CaF, may be
shown as:

Ca > Ca** + Qe

[Ar]4s? [Ar]

Ft+e > F-

[He] 2s? 2p° [He] 2s? 2p° or [Ne]

Ca**+2F + CaF, or Ca**(F’),

The bond formed, as a result of the
electrostatic attraction between the
positive and negative ions was termed as

102

the electrovalent bond. The electrovalence
is thus equal to the number of unit charge(s)
on the ion. Thus, calcium is assigned a
positive electrovalence of two, while chlorine
a negative electrovalence of one.

K6ssel’s postulations provide the basis for
the modern concepts regarding ion-formation
by electron transfer and the formation of ionic
crystalline compounds. His views have proved
to be of great value in the understanding and
systematisation of the ionic compounds. At
the same time he did recognise the fact that
a large number of compounds did not fit into
these concepts.

4.1.1 Octet Rule

Koéssel and Lewis in 1916 developed an
important theory of chemical combination
between atoms known as electronic theory
of chemical bonding. According to this,
atoms can combine either by transfer of
valence electrons from one atom to another
(gaining or losing) or by sharing of valence
electrons in order to have an octet in their
valence shells. This is known as octet rule.

4.1.2 Covalent Bond

Langmuir (1919) refined the Lewis
postulations by abandoning the idea of
the stationary cubical arrangement of the
octet, and by introducing the term covalent
bond. The Lewis-Langmuir theory can be
understood by considering the formation of
the chlorine molecule, Cl,. The Cl atom with
electronic configuration, [Ne]3s? 3p’, is one
electron short of the argon configuration.
The formation of the Cl, molecule can be
understood in terms of the sharing of a pair
of electrons between the two chlorine atoms,
each chlorine atom contributing one electron
to the shared pair. In the process both

or Cl —- Cl
Covalent bond between two Cl atoms

CHEMISTRY

chlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of
the nearest noble gas (i.e., argon).

The dots represent electrons. Such
structures are referred to as Lewis dot
structures.

The Lewis dot structures can be written for
other molecules also, in which the combining
atoms may be identical or different. The
important conditions being that:

e Each bond is formed as a result of sharing
of an electron pair between the atoms.

e Each combining atom contributes at least
one electron to the shared pair.

e The combining atoms attain the outer-
shell noble gas configurations as a result
of the sharing of electrons.

e Thus in water and carbon tetrachloride
molecules, formation of covalent bonds
can be represented as:

H atoms attain a duplet of
electrons and O, the octet

Each of the four Cl atoms
along with the C atom attains
octet of electrons

Thus, when two atoms share one
electron pair they are said to be joined by
a single covalent bond. In many compounds
we have multiple bonds between atoms. The
formation of multiple bonds envisages sharing
of more than one electron pair between two
atoms. If two atoms share two pairs of
electrons, the covalent bond between them
is called a double bond. For example, in the
carbon dioxide molecule, we have two double
bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms.
Similarly in ethene molecule the two carbon
atoms are joined by a double bond.

4.1.3 Lewis Representation of. Simple
Molecules (the Lewis Structures)

The Lewis dot structures provide a picture
of bonding in molecules and ions in terms of
the shared pairs of electrons and the octet
rule. While such a picture may not explain
the bonding and behaviour of a molecule
completely, it does help in understanding the
formation and properties of a molecule to a
large extent. Writing of Lewis dot structures of
molecules is, therefore, very useful. The Lewis
dot structures can be written by adopting the
following steps:

e The total number of electrons required
for writing the structures are obtained
by adding the valence electrons of the
combining atoms. For example, in the CH,
molecule there are eight valence electrons
available for bonding (4 from carbon and
4 from the four hydrogen atoms).

e For anions, each negative charge would
mean addition of one electron. For cations,
each positive charge would result in
subtraction of one electron from the total

103

number of valence electrons. For example,
for the CO? ion, the two negative charges
indicate that there are two additional
electrons than those provided by the
neutral atoms. For NH{ ion, one positive
charge indicates the loss of one electron
from the group of neutral atoms.

e Knowing the chemical symbols of the
combining atoms and having knowledge
of the skeletal structure of the compound
(known or guessed intelligently), it is easy
to distribute the total number of electrons
as bonding shared pairs between the
atoms in proportion to the total bonds.

e In general the least electronegative atom
occupies the central position in the
molecule/ion. For example in the NF, and
CO, nitrogen and carbon are the central
atoms whereas fluorine and oxygen
occupy the terminal positions.

e After accounting for the shared pairs of
electrons for single bonds, the remaining
electron pairs are either utilized for
multiple bonding or remain as the lone
pairs. The basic requirement being
that each bonded atom gets an octet of
electrons.

Lewis representations of a few molecules /
ions are given in Table 4.1.

Problem 4.1

Write the Lewis dot structure of CO
molecule.

Solution

Step 1. Count the total number of valence
electrons of carbon and oxygen atoms.
The outer (valence) shell configurations
of carbon and oxygen atoms are: 2s? 2p”
and 2s* 2p*, respectively. The valence
electrons available are 4 + 6 =10.

Step 2. The skeletal structure of CO is
written as: C O

Step 3. Draw a single bond (one shared
electron pair) between C and O and
complete the octet on O, the remaining
two electrons are the lone pair on C.

;C Yor or ;C—O:

This does not complete the octet on
carbon and hence we have to resort to
multiple bonding (in this case a triple
bond) between C and O atoms. This
satisfies the octet rule condition for both

atoms.

Problem 4.2

ion, NO>.

valence electrons of the nitrogen atom,
the oxygen atoms and the additional one
negative charge (equal to one electron).

Step 2. The skeletal structure of NO; is

Step 3. Draw a single bond (one shared

each of the oxygen atoms completing the
octets on oxygen atoms. This, however,
does not complete the octet on nitrogen
if the remaining two electrons constitute
lone pair on it.

Hence we have to resort to multiple
bonding between nitrogen and one of
the oxygen atoms (in this case a double
bond). This leads to the following Lewis
dot structures.

4.1.4 Formal Charge

Lewis dot structures, in general, do not
represent the actual shapes of the molecules.
In case of polyatomic ions, the net charge is
possessed by the ion as a whole and not by
a particular atom. It is, however, feasible to
assign a formal charge on each atom. The
formal charge of an atom in a polyatomic
molecule or ion may be defined as the
difference between the number of valence
electrons of that atom in an isolated or free
state and the number of electrons assigned
to that atom in the Lewis structure. It is
expressed as :

Formal charge (F.C.)
on an atom in a Lewis =

electrons in the free —| bonding (lone pair)

electrons

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

The counting is based on the assumption
that the atom in the molecule owns one
electron of each shared pair and both the
electrons of a lone pair.

Let us consider the ozone molecule (O,).
The Lewis structure of O, may be drawn as:

The atoms have been numbered as 1, 2
and 3. The formal charge on:

e The central O atom marked 1

-6-2-+ 6-41
2

e The end O atom marked 2

-6-4-1 (4)=0
D

e The end O atom marked 3

-6-6-1 (2)=-1
D

Hence, we represent O, along with the
formal charges as follows:

JS,

We must understand that formal charges
do not indicate real charge separation within
the molecule. Indicating the charges on the
atoms in the Lewis structure only helps in
keeping track of the valence electrons in
the molecule. Formal charges help in the
selection of the lowest energy structure from
a number of possible Lewis structures for a
given species. Generally the lowest energy
structure is the one with the smallest
formal charges on the atoms. The formal
charge is a factor based on a pure covalent
view of bonding in which electron pairs
are shared equally by neighbouring atoms.

4.1.5 Limitations of the Octet Rule

The octet rule, though useful, is not universal.
It is quite useful for understanding the
structures of most of the organic compounds
and it applies mainly to the second period
elements of the periodic table. There are three
types of exceptions to the octet rule.

The incomplete octet of the central atom

In some compounds, the number of electrons
surrounding the central atom is less than
eight. This is especially the case with elements
having less than four valence electrons.
Examples are LiCl, BeH, and BCl,.

Cl
Li:Cl H:Be:H  Cl:B:Cl
Li, Be and B have 1, 2 and 3 valence electrons
only. Some other such compounds are AICl,

and BF,.

Odd-electron molecules

In molecules with an odd number of electrons
like nitric oxide, NO and nitrogen dioxide,
NO,, the octet rule is not satisfied for all the
atoms

The expanded octet

Elements in and beyond the third period of
the periodic table have, apart from 3s and 3p
orbitals, 3d orbitals also available for bonding.
In a number of compounds of these elements
there are more than eight valence electrons
around the central atom. This is termed as
the expanded octet. Obviously the octet rule
does not apply in such cases.

Some of the examples of such compounds
are: PF., SF,, H,SO, and a number of
coordination compounds.

Interestingly, sulphur also forms many
compounds in which the octet rule is obeyed.
In sulphur dichloride, the S atom has an octet
of electrons around it.

:Cl—S — Cl: or Cl! s! Cl!

Other drawbacks “of the octet theory

e It is clear that octet rule is based upon
the chemical inertness of noble gases.
However, some noble gases (for example
xenon and krypton) also combine with
oxygen and fluorine to form a number of
compounds like XeF,,, KrF, XeOF, etc.

e This theory does not account for the shape
of molecules.

e It does not explain the relative stability of
the molecules being totally silent about
the energy of a molecule.

4.2 IONIC OR ELECTROVALENT BOND

From the Kossel and Lewis treatment of the
formation of an ionic bond, it follows that the
formation of ionic compounds would primarily
depend upon:

e The ease of formation of the positive and
negative ions from the respective neutral
atoms;

e The arrangement of the positive and
negative ions in the solid, that is, the
lattice of the crystalline compound.

The formation of a positive ion involves
ionization, i.e., removal of electron(s) from
the neutral atom and that of the negative
ion involves the addition of electron(s) to the
neutral atom.

The electron gain enthalpy, A__H, is the
enthalpy change (Unit 3), when a gas phase
atom in its ground state gains an electron.
The electron gain process may be exothermic
or endothermic. The ionization, on the other
hand, is always endothermic. Electron

CHEMISTRY

affinity, is the negative of the energy change
accompanying electron gain.

Obviously ionic bonds will be formed
more easily between elements with
comparatively low ionization enthalpies
and elements with comparatively high
negative value of electron gain enthalpy.

Most ionic compounds have cations
derived from metallic elements and anions
from non-metallic elements. The ammonium
ion, NH; (made up of two non-metallic
elements) is an exception. It forms the cation
of a number of ionic compounds.

Ionic compounds in the crystalline
state consist of orderly three-dimensional
arrangements of cations and anions held
together by coulombic interaction energies.
These compounds crystallise in different
crystal structures determined by the size of
the ions, their packing arrangements and
other factors. The crystal structure of sodium
chloride, NaCl (rock salt), for example is
shown below.

Cl-
Na'—>

ev

In ionic solids, the sum of the electron gain
enthalpy and the ionization enthalpy may be
positive but still the crystal structure gets
stabilized due to the energy released in the
formation of the crystal lattice. For example:
the ionization enthalpy for Na*(g) formation
from Na(g) is 495.8 kJ mol’; while the electron
gain enthalpy for the change Cl(g) + e->
CI (g) is, - 348.7 kJ mol" only. The sum of the
two, 147.1 kJ mol’ is more than compensated
for by the enthalpy of lattice formation of
NaCl(s) (-788 kJ mot’). Therefore, the energy
released in the processes is more than the

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

energy absorbed. Thus a qualitative measure
of the stability of an ionic compound
is provided by its enthalpy of lattice
formation and not simply by achieving
octet of electrons around the ionic species
in gaseous state.

Since lattice enthalpy plays a key role
in the formation of ionic compounds, it is
important that we learn more about it.

4.2.1 Lattice Enthalpy

The Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid
is defined as the energy required to
completely separate one mole of a solid
ionic compound into gaseous constituent
ions. For example, the lattice enthalpy of
NaCl is 788 kJ mol'. This means that 788
kJ of energy is required to separate one mole
of solid NaCl into one mole of Na’* (g) and one
mole of Cl (g) to an infinite distance.

This process involves both the attractive
forces between ions of opposite charges
and the repulsive forces between ions of
like charge. The solid crystal being three-
dimensional; it is not possible to calculate
lattice enthalpy directly from the interaction
of forces of attraction and repulsion only.
Factors associated with the crystal geometry
have to be included.

4.3 BOND PARAMETERS

4.3.1 Bond Length

Bond length is defined as the equilibrium
distance between the nuclei of two bonded
atoms in a molecule. Bond lengths are
measured by spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction
and electron-diffraction techniques about
which you will learn in higher classes. Each
atom of the bonded pair contributes to the
bond length (Fig. 4.1). In the case ofa covalent
bond, the contribution from each atom is
called the covalent radius of that atom.

The covalent radius is measured
approximately as the radius of an atom’s
core which is in contact with the core of an
adjacent atom in a bonded situation. The
covalent radius is half of the distance between
two similar atoms joined by a covalent bond

in the same molecule. The van der Waals
radius represents the overall size of the
atom which includes its valence shell ina
nonbonded situation. Further, the van der
Waals radius is half of the distance between
two similar atoms in separate molecules in
a solid. Covalent and van der Waals radii of
chlorine are depicted in Fig. 4.2.

Some typical average bond lengths for
single, double and triple bonds are shown in
Table 4.2. Bond lengths for some common
molecules are given in Table 4.3.

The covalent radii of some common
elements are listed in Table 4.4.

4.3.2 Bond Angle

It is defined as the angle between the orbitals
containing bonding electron pairs around the
central atom in a molecule/complex ion. Bond
angle is expressed in degree which can be
experimentally determined by spectroscopic
methods. It gives some idea regarding the
distribution of orbitals around the central
atom in a molecule/complex ion and hence it
helps us in determining its shape. For
example H—O-H bond angle in water can be
represented as under :

:O:
oN
H H

4.3.3 Bond Enthalpy

It is defined as the amount of energy required
to break one mole of bonds of a particular
type between two atoms in a gaseous state.
The unit of bond enthalpy is kJ mol’. For
example, the H—H bond enthalpy in hydrogen
molecule is 435.8 kJ mol'!.

H,(g) > H(g) + H(g); A.H° = 435.8 kJ mol’

Similarly the bond enthalpy for molecules
containing multiple bonds, for example O, and
N, will be as under :

O, (O = O) (g) > O(g) + Ofg);
A He = 498 kJ mol"

N, (N =N) (g) > N(g) + N(g);
AH? = 946.0 kJ mol

It is important that larger the bond
dissociation enthalpy, stronger will be the
bond in the molecule. For a heteronuclear
diatomic molecules like HCl, we have
HCl (g) > H(g) + Cl (g); A,H° = 431.0 kJ mol’

In case of polyatomic molecules, the
measurement of bond strength is more
complicated. For example in case of H,O
molecule, the enthalpy needed to break the
two O —-H bonds is not the same.

H,O(g) > H(g) + OH(g); A.W? = 502 kJ mol"
OH(g) — H(g) + O(g); AHS = 427 kJ mol’

The difference in the A,H° value shows
that the second O - H bond undergoes
some change because of changed chemical
environment. This is the reason for some
difference in energy of the same O — H bond
in different molecules like C,H,OH (ethanol)
and water. Therefore in polyatomic molecules
the term mean or average bond enthalpy
is used. It is obtained by dividing total bond
dissociation enthalpy by the number of bonds
broken as explained below in case of water

4.3.4 Bond Order

In the Lewis description of covalent bond,
the Bond Order is given by the number
of bonds between the two atoms in a
molecule. The bond order, for example in
H, (with a single shared electron pair), in O,
(with two shared electron pairs) and in N,
(with three shared electron pairs) is 1,2,3
respectively. Similarly in CO (three shared
electron pairs between C and O) the bond
order is 3. For N,, bond order is 3 and its
A,H® is 946 kJ mot’; being one of the highest
for a diatomic molecule.

Isoelectronic molecules and ions have
identical bond orders; for example, F, and
O have bond order 1. N,, CO and NO* have
bond order 3.

A general correlation useful for
understanding the stablities of molecules
is that: with increase in bond order,
bond enthalpy increases and bond length
decreases.

4.3.5 Resonance Structures

It is often observed that a single Lewis structure
is inadequate for the representation of a
molecule in conformity with its experimentally
determined parameters. For example, the
ozone, O, molecule can be equally represented
by the structures I and II shown below:

(structures I and II represent the two canonical
forms while the structure IIT is the resonance hybrid)

In both structures we have a O-O single
bond and a O=O double bond. The normal
O-O and O=O bond lengths are 148 pm
and 121 pm respectively. Experimentally
determined oxygen-oxygen bond lengths in
the O, molecule are same (128 pm). Thus the
oxygen-oxygen bonds in the O, molecule are
intermediate between a double and a single
bond. Obviously, this cannot be represented
by either of the two Lewis structures shown
above.

The concept of resonance was introduced
to deal with the type of difficulty experienced
in the depiction of accurate structures of
molecules like O,. According to the concept
of resonance, whenever a single Lewis
structure cannot describe a molecule
accurately, a number of structures with
similar energy, positions of nuclei, bonding
and non-bonding pairs of electrons are
taken as the canonical structures of the
hybrid which describes the molecule
accurately. Thus for O,, the two structures
shown above constitute the canonical
structures or resonance structures and
their hybrid i.e., the III structure represents
the structure of O, more accurately. This is
also called resonance hybrid. Resonance is
represented by a double headed arrow.

Some of the other examples of resonance
structures are provided by the carbonate ion
and the carbon dioxide molecule.

Explain the structure of CO? ion in
terms of resonance.

Solution

The single Lewis structure based on
the presence of two single bonds and
one double bond between carbon
and oxygen atoms is inadequate to
represent the molecule accurately as it
represents unequal bonds. According
to the experimental findings, all carbon
to oxygen bonds in CO% are equivalent.
Therefore the carbonate ion is best
described as a resonance hybrid of the
canonical forms I, II, and II] shown below.

Problem 4.4

Explain the structure of CO, molecule.

Solution

The experimentally determined carbon
to oxygen bond length in CO, is
115 pm. The lengths of a normal
carbon to oxygen double bond (C=O)
and carbon to oxygen triple bond (C=O)
are 121 pm and 110 pm respectively.
The carbon-oxygen bond lengths in
CO, (115 pm) lie between the values
for C=O and C=O. Obviously, a single
Lewis structure cannot depict this
position and it becomes necessary to
write more than one Lewis structures
and to consider that the structure of
CO, is best described as a hybrid of
the canonical or resonance forms I, II
and III.

In general, it may be stated that

e Resonance stabilizes the molecule as the
energy of the resonance hybrid is less
than the energy of any single cannonical
structure; and,

e Resonance averages the bond
characteristics as a whole.

Thus the energy of the O, resonance
hybrid is lower than either of the two
cannonical froms I and II (Fig. 4.3).

Many misconceptions are associated
with resonance and the same need to be
dispelled. You should remember that :

e The cannonical forms have no real
existence.

e The molecule does not exist for a certain
fraction of time in one cannonical form
and for other fractions of time in other
cannonical forms.

e There is no such equilibrium between
the cannonical forms as we have
between tautomeric forms (keto and
enol) in tautomerism.

e The molecule as such has a single
structure which is the resonance
hybrid of the cannonical forms and
which cannot as such be depicted by
a single Lewis structure.

4.3.6 Polarity of Bonds

The existence of a hundred percent ionic or
covalent bond represents an ideal situation.
In reality no bond or a compound is either
completely covalent or ionic. Even in case of
covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms,
there is some ionic character.

When covalent bond is formed between
two similar atoms, for example in H,, O,,
Cl,, N, or F,, the shared pair of electrons is
equally attracted by the two atoms. As a result

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

electron pair is situated exactly between the
two identical nuclei. The bond so formed is
called nonpolar covalent bond. Contrary to
this in case of a heteronuclear molecule like
HF, the shared electron pair between the two
atoms gets displaced more towards fluorine
since the electronegativity of fluorine (Unit 3)
is far greater than that of hydrogen. The
resultant covalent bond is a polar covalent
bond.

As a result of polarisation, the molecule
possesses the dipole moment (depicted
below) which can be defined as the product of
the magnitude of the charge and the distance
between the centres of positive and negative
charge. It is usually designated by a Greek
letter ‘uw’. Mathematically, it is expressed as
follows :

Dipole moment (yu) = charge (Q) x distance of

separation (r)
Dipole moment is usually expressed in
Debye units (D). The conversion factor is

1D =3.33564 x 10°° Cm
where C is coulomb and m is meter.

Further dipole moment is a vector quantity
and by convention it is depicted by a small
arrow with tail on the negative centre and
head pointing towards the positive centre.
But in chemistry presence of dipole moment
is represented by the crossed arrow (+—>)
put on Lewis structure of the molecule. The
cross is on positive end and arrow head is on
negative end. For example the dipole moment
of HF may be represented as :

+—->..

This arrow symbolises the direction of the
shift of electron density in the molecule. Note
that the direction of crossed arrow is opposite
to the conventional direction of dipole moment
vector.

Peter Debye, the Dutch chemist
received Nobel prize in 1936 for
his work on X-ray diffraction and

dipole moments. The magnitude
of the dipole moment is given in
Debye units in order to honour him.

111

In case of polyatomic molecules the dipole
moment not only depend upon the individual
dipole moments of bonds known as bond
dipoles but also on the spatial arrangement
of various bonds in the molecule. In such
case, the dipole moment of a molecule is the
vector sum of the dipole moments of various
bonds. For example in H,O molecule, which
has a bent structure, the two O-H bonds are
oriented at an angle of 104.5°. Net dipole
moment of 6.17 x 10°°C m (1D = 3.33564
x 10°° C m) is the resultant of the dipole
moments of two O-H bonds.

dipole moment of NH, (4.90 x 10°° C m) is
greater than that of NF, (0.8 x 10°° C m). This
is because, in case of NH, the orbital dipole
due to lone pair is in the same direction as
the resultant dipole moment of the N - H
bonds, whereas in NF, the orbital dipole is in
the direction opposite to the resultant dipole
moment of the three N-F bonds. The orbital
dipole because of lone pair decreases the effect
of the resultant N — F bond moments, which
results in the low dipole moment of NF, as

Dipole moments of some molecules are

Just as all the covalent bonds have
some partial ionic character, the ionic
bonds also have partial covalent character.
The partial covalent character of ionic
bonds was discussed by Fajans in terms of
the following rules:

CHEMISTRY

e The smaller the size of the cation and the
larger the size of the anion, the greater
the covalent character of an ionic bond.

e The greater the charge on the cation, the
greater the covalent character of the ionic
bond.

e For cations of the same size and charge,
the one, with electronic configuration
(n-1)d°ns°, typical of transition metals, is
more polarising than the one with a noble
gas configuration, ns? np®, typical of alkali
and alkaline earth metal cations.

The cation polarises the anion, pulling
the electronic charge toward itself and
thereby increasing the electronic charge
between the two. This is precisely what
happens in a covalent bond, i.e., buildup
of electron charge density between the
nuclei. The polarising power of the cation,
the polarisability of the anion and the
extent of distortion (polarisation) of anion
are the factors, which determine the per
cent covalent character of the ionic bond.

4.4 THE VALENCE SHELL ELECTRON
PAIR REPULSION (VSEPR) THEORY

As already explained, Lewis concept is unable
to explain the shapes of molecules. This
theory provides a simple procedure to predict
the shapes of covalent molecules. Sidgwick

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

and Powell in 1940, proposed a simple theory
based on the repulsive interactions of the
electron pairs in the valence shell of the
atoms. It was further developed and redefined
by Nyholm and Gillespie (1957).

The main postulates of VSEPR theory are
as follows:

e The shape of a molecule depends upon
the number of valence shell electron pairs
(bonded or nonbonded) around the central
atom.

e Pairs of electrons in the valence shell repel
one another since their electron clouds are
negatively charged.

e These pairs of electrons tend to occupy
such positions in space that minimise
repulsion and thus maximise distance
between them.

e The valence shell is taken as a sphere
with the electron pairs localising on the
spherical surface at maximum distance
from one another.

e A multiple bond is treated as ifit is a single
electron pair and the two or three electron
pairs of a multiple bond are treated as a
single super pair.

e Where two or more resonance structures
can represent a molecule, the VSEPR
model is applicable to any such structure.

The repulsive interaction of electron pairs
decrease in the order:

Lone pair (lp) — Lone pair (lp) > Lone pair
(lp) - Bond pair (bp) > Bond pair (bp) -
Bond pair (bp)

Nyholm and Gillespie (1957) refined the
VSEPR model by explaining the important
difference between the lone pairs and bonding
pairs of electrons. While the lone pairs are
localised on the central atom, each bonded
pair is shared between two atoms. As a result,
the lone pair electrons in a molecule occupy
more space as compared to the bonding pairs
of electrons. This results in greater repulsion
between lone pairs of electrons as compared
to the lone pair - bond pair and bond pair -
bond pair repulsions. These repulsion effects

113

result in deviations from idealised shapes and
alterations in bond angles in molecules.

For the prediction of geometrical shapes
of molecules with the help of VSEPR theory,
it is convenient to divide molecules into
two categories as (i) molecules in which
the central atom has no lone pair and
(ii) molecules in which the central atom
has one or more lone pairs.

Table 4.6 (pagel1l14) shows the
arrangement of electron pairs about a
central atom A (without any lone pairs) and
geometries of some molecules/ions of the type
AB. Table 4.7 (page 115) shows shapes of some
simple molecules and ions in which the central
atom has one or more lone pairs. Table 4.8
(page 116) explains the reasons for the
distortions in the geometry of the molecule.

As depicted in Table 4.6, in the
compounds of AB,, AB,, AB,, AB, and AB,,
the arrangement of electron pairs and the
B atoms around the central atom A are :
linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral,
trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral,
respectively. Such arrangement can be seen
in the molecules like BF, (AB,), CH, (AB,) and
PCl. (AB.) as depicted below by their ball and

stick models.

The VSEPR Theory is able to predict
geometry of a large number of molecules,
especially the compounds of p-block elements
accurately. It is also quite successful in
determining the geometry quite-accurately
even when the energy difference between
possible structures is very small. The
theoretical basis of the VSEPR theory regarding
the effects of electron pair repulsions on
molecular shapes is not clear and continues
to be a subject of doubt and discussion.

Reason for the
shape acquired

Theoretically the shape
should have been triangular
planar but actually it is found
to be bent or v-shaped. The
reason being the lone pair-
bond pair repulsion is much
more as compared to the bond
pair-bond pair repulsion. So
the angle is reduced to 119.5°
from 120°.

Had there been a bp in place
of lp the shape would have
been tetrahedral but one
lone pair is present and due
to the repulsion between
Ip-bp (which is more than
bp-bp repulsion) the angle
between bond pairs is
reduced to 107° from 109.5°.

The shape should have been
tetrahedral if there were all bp
but two lp are present so the
shape is distorted tetrahedral
or angular. The reason is
Ip-lp repulsion is more than
lp-bp repulsion which is more
than bp-bp repulsion. Thus,
the angle is reduced to 104.5°
from 109.5°.

In (a) the lp is present at axial
position so there are three
Ip—bp repulsions at 90°.
In(b) the lp is in an equatorial
position, and there are two
Ip—bp repulsions. Hence,
arrangement (b) is more
stable. The shape shown in
(b) is described as a distorted
tetrahedron, a folded square
or a see-saw.

4.5 VALENCE BOND THEORY

As we know that Lewis approach helps in
writing the structure of molecules but it
fails to explain the formation of chemical
bond. It also does not give any reason for the
difference in bond dissociation enthalpies and
bond lengths in molecules like H, (435.8 kJ
mol’, 74 pm) and F, (155 kJ mol", 144 pm),
although in both the cases a single covalent
bond is formed by the sharing of an electron
pair between the respective atoms. It also
gives no idea about the shapes of polyatomic
molecules.

Similarly the VSEPR theory gives the
geometry of simple molecules but theoretically,
it does not explain them and also it has limited
applications. To overcome these limitations
the two important theories based on quantum
mechanical principles are introduced. These
are valence bond (VB) theory and molecular
orbital (MO) theory.

Valence bond theory was introduced
by Heitler and London (1927) and developed
further by Pauling and others. A discussion

of the valence bond theory is based on the
knowledge of atomic orbitals, electronic
configurations of elements (Units 2), the
overlap criteria of atomic orbitals, the
hybridization of atomic orbitals and the
principles of variation and superposition. A
rigorous treatment of the VB theory in terms
of these aspects is beyond the scope of this
book. Therefore, for the sake of convenience,
valence bond theory has been discussed in
terms of qualitative and non-mathematical
treatment only. To start with, let us consider
the formation of hydrogen molecule which is
the simplest of all molecules.

Consider two hydrogen atoms A and B
approaching each other having nuclei N,
and N, and electrons present in them are
represented by e, and e,. When the two atoms
are at large distance from each other, there
is no interaction between them. As these two
atoms approach each other, new attractive
and repulsive forces begin to operate.

Attractive forces arise between:
(i) | nucleus of one atom and its own electron
that is N, —e, and N,- e,.

(ii) nucleus of one atom and electron of
other atom i.e., N,— e,, N,- e,.

Similarly repulsive forces arise between

(i) | electrons of two atoms like e, — e,,

(ii) nuclei of two atoms N, —N,,.

Attractive forces tend to bring the two
atoms close to each other whereas repulsive
forces tend to push them apart (Fig. 4.7).

Repulsive Forces

Fig. 4.7 Forces of attraction and repulsion
during the formation of H, molecule

Experimentally it has been found that
the magnitude of new attractive force is
more than the new repulsive forces. As a
result, two atoms approach each other and
potential energy decreases. Ultimately a stage
is reached where the net force of attraction
balances the force of repulsion and system
acquires minimum energy. At this stage
two hydrogen atoms are said to be bonded

CHEMISTRY

together to form a stable molecule having the
bond length of 74 pm.

Since the energy gets released when the
bond is formed between two hydrogen atoms,
the hydrogen molecule is more stable than
that of isolated hydrogen atoms. The energy
so released is called as bond enthalpy, which
is corresponding to minimum in the curve
depicted in Fig. 4.8. Conversely, 435.8 kJ of
energy is required to dissociate one mole of
H, molecule.

4.5.1 Orbital Overlap Concept

In the formation of hydrogen molecule,
there is a minimum energy state when two
hydrogen atoms are so near that their atomic
orbitals undergo partial interpenetration. This
partial merging of atomic orbitals is called
overlapping of atomic orbitals which results in
the pairing of electrons. The extent of overlap
decides the strength of a covalent bond. In
general, greater the overlap the stronger is the
bond formed between two atoms. Therefore,
according to orbital overlap concept, the
formation of a covalent bond between two
atoms results by pairing of electrons present
in the valence shell having opposite spins.

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

4.5.2 Directional Properties of Bonds

As we have already seen, the covalent bond
is formed by overlapping of atomic orbitals.
The molecule of hydrogen is formed due to the
overlap of 1s-orbitals of two H atoms.

In case of polyatomic molecules like CH,,
NH, and H,O, the geometry of the molecules
is also important in addition to the bond
formation. For example why is it so that CH,
molecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH
bond angles are 109.5°? Why is the shape of
NH, molecule pyramidal ?

The valence bond theory explains the
shape, the formation and directional properties
of bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH,,
NH, and H,O, etc. in terms of overlap and
hybridisation of atomic orbitals.

4.5.3 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals

When orbitals of two atoms come close to form
bond, their overlap may be positive, negative
or zero depending upon the sign (phase) and
direction of orientation of amplitude of orbital
wave function in space (Fig. 4.9). Positive and
negative sign on boundary surface diagrams
in the Fig. 4.9 show the sign (phase) of orbital
wave function and are not related to charge.
Orbitals forming bond should have same sign
(phase) and orientation in space. This is called
positive overlap. Various overlaps of s and p
orbitals are depicted in Fig. 4.9.

The criterion of overlap, as the main factor
for the formation of covalent bonds applies
uniformly to the homonuclear /heteronuclear
diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules.
We know that the shapes of CH,, NH,, and
H,O molecules are tetrahedral, pyramidal
and bent respectively. It would be therefore
interesting to use VB theory to find out if these
geometrical shapes can be explained in terms
of the orbital overlaps.

Let us first consider the CH, (methane)
molecule. The electronic configuration of
carbon in its ground state is [He]2s* 2p? which
in the excited state becomes [He] 2s' 2p. 2 P,
2p,'. The energy required for this excitation is
compensated by the release of energy due to
overlap between the orbitals of carbon and the

hydrogen. The four atomic orbitals of carbon,
each with an unpaired electron can overlap
with the 1s orbitals of the four H atoms which
are also singly occupied. This will result in the
formation of four C-H bonds. It will, however,
be observed that while the three p orbitals of
carbon are at 90 to one another, the HCH
angle for these will also be 90’. That is three
C-H bonds will be oriented at 90 to one
another. The 2s orbital of carbon and the 1s
orbital of H are spherically symmetrical and
they can overlap in any direction. Therefore
the direction of the fourth C-H bond cannot
be ascertained. This description does not fit
in with the tetrahedral HCH angles of 109.5.
Clearly, it follows that simple atomic orbital
overlap does not account for the directional
characteristics of bonds in CH,. Using similar
procedure and arguments, it can be seen that in
the case of NH, and H,O molecules, the HNH

120

and HOH angles should be 90. This is in
disagreement with the actual bond angles of
107 and 104.5’ in the NH, and H,O molecules
respectively.

4.5.4 Types of Overlapping and Nature of
Covalent Bonds

The covalent bond may be classified into

two types depending upon the types of

overlapping:

(i) Sigma(o) bond, and (ii) pi(z) bond

(i) Sigma(o) bond : This type of covalent
bond is formed by the end to end (head-
on) overlap of bonding orbitals along the
internuclear axis. This is called as head
on overlap or axial overlap. This can be
formed by any one of the following types
of combinations of atomic orbitals.

e =6©s-s overlapping : In this case, there is
overlap of two half filled s-orbitals along
the internuclear axis as shown below :

participating atoms.

4.5.5 Strength of Sigma and pi Bonds

Basically the strength of a bond depends
upon the extent of overlapping. In case of
sigma bond, the overlapping of orbitals takes
place to a larger extent. Hence, it is stronger
as compared to the pi bond where the extent
of overlapping occurs to a smaller extent.
Further, it is important to note that in the
formation of multiple bonds between two
atoms of a molecule, pi bond(s) is formed in
addition to a sigma bond.

4.6 HYBRIDISATION

In order to explain the characteristic
geometrical shapes of polyatomic molecules
like CH,, NH, and H,O etc., Pauling introduced
the concept of hybridisation. According to him
the atomic orbitals combine to form new set of
equivalent orbitals known as hybrid orbitals.
Unlike pure orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are
used in bond formation. The phenomenon is
known as hybridisation which can be defined
as the process of intermixing of the orbitals of
slightly different energies so as to redistribute
their energies, resulting in the formation of
new set of orbitals of equivalent energies and
shape. For example when one 2s and three
2p-orbitals of carbon hybridise, there is the
formation of four new sp° hybrid orbitals.

Salient features of hybridisation: The main

features of hybridisation are as under :

1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to
the number of the atomic orbitals that get
hybridised.

2. The hybridised orbitals are always
equivalent in energy and shape.

Reprint 2025-26

9/12/2022 9:36:14 AM

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

3. The hybrid orbitals are more effective in
forming stable bonds than the pure atomic
orbitals.

4. These hybrid orbitals are directed in
space in some preferred direction to have
minimum repulsion between electron
pairs and thus a stable arrangement.
Therefore, the type of hybridisation
indicates the geometry of the molecules.

Important conditions for hybridisation

(i) |The orbitals present in the valence shell
of the atom are hybridised.

(ii) The orbitals undergoing hybridisation
should have almost equal energy.

Promotion of electron is not essential
condition prior to hybridisation.

(iv) It is not necessary that only half filled
orbitals participate in hybridisation.
In some cases, even filled orbitals of
valence shell take part in hybridisation.

4.6.1 Types of Hybridisation

There are various types of hybridisation
involving s, p and d orbitals. The different
types of hybridisation are as under:

(I) sp hybridisation: This type of hybridisation
involves the mixing of one s and one p orbital
resulting in the formation of two equivalent
sp hybrid orbitals. The suitable orbitals for
sp hybridisation are s and p, if the hybrid
orbitals are to lie along the z-axis. Each sp
hybrid orbitals has 50% s-character and
50% p-character. Such a molecule in which
the central atom is sp-hybridised and linked
directly to two other central atoms possesses
linear geometry. This type of hybridisation is
also known as diagonal hybridisation.

The two sp hybrids point in the opposite
direction along the z-axis with projecting
positive lobes and very small negative lobes,
which provides more effective overlapping

resulting in the formation of stronger bonds.
Example of molecule

BeCl,: The ground state electronic
configuration of Be is 1s’2s’. In the exited
state one of the 2s-electrons is promoted to

vacant 2p orbital to account for its bivalency.
One 2s and one 2p-orbital gets hybridised to
form two sp hybridised orbitals. These two
sp hybrid orbitals are oriented in opposite

the sp hybridised orbital overlaps with the
2p-orbital of chlorine axially and form two Be-
Cl sigma bonds. This is shown in Fig. 4.10.

(II) sp? hybridisation : In this hybridisation
there is involvement of one s and two
p-orbitals in order to form three equivalent
sp’? hybridised orbitals. For example, in

a result boron has three unpaired electrons.
These three orbitals (one 2s and two 2p)
hybridise to form three sp” hybrid orbitals.
The three hybrid orbitals so formed are
oriented in a trigonal planar arrangement
and overlap with 2p orbitals of chlorine to
form three B-Cl bonds. Therefore, in BCI,
(Fig. 4.11), the geometry is trigonal planar
with CIBCI1 bond angle of 120°.

(III) sp* hybridisation: This type of
hybridisation can be explained by taking the
example of CH, molecule in which there is
mixing of one s-orbital and three p-orbitals
of the valence shell to form four sp* hybrid
orbital of equivalent energies and shape. There
is 25% s-character and 75% p-character in
each sp°* hybrid orbital. The four sp’ hybrid
orbitals so formed are directed towards the
four corners of the tetrahedron. The angle
between sp® hybrid orbital is 109.5° as shown
in Fig. 4.12.

hybridisation. In NH,, the valence shell (outer)
electronic configuration of nitrogen in the

ground state is 2S°2p.2p,2P, having three
unpaired electrons in the sp*® hybrid orbitals
and a lone pair of electrons is present in the
fourth one. These three hybrid orbitals overlap
with 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form
three N-H sigma bonds. We know that the
force of repulsion between a lone pair anda
bond pair is more than the force of repulsion
between two bond pairs of electrons. The
molecule thus gets distorted and the bond
angle is reduced to 107° from 109.5°. The
geometry of such a molecule will be pyramidal
as shown in Fig. 4.13.

Ammonia, NH,

Fig.4.13 Formation of NH, molecule

In case of H,O molecule, the four oxygen
orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) undergo sp*°
hybridisation forming four sp* hybrid orbitals
out of which two contain one electron each and
the other two contain a pair of electrons. These
four sp® hybrid orbitals acquire a tetrahedral
geometry, with two corners occupied by
hydrogen atoms while the other two by the
lone pairs. The bond angle in this case is
reduced to 104.5° from 109.5° (Fig. 4.14)
and the molecule thus acquires a V-shape or
angular geometry.

4.6.2 Other Examples of sp*, sp”? and sp
Hybridisation

sp* Hybridisation in C,H, molecule: In
ethane molecule both the carbon atoms
assume sp’ hybrid state. One of the four
sp°® hybrid orbitals of carbon atom overlaps
axially with similar orbitals of other atom to
form sp*-sp’ sigma bond while the other three
hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom are used
in forming sp*—-s sigma bonds with hydrogen
atoms as discussed in section 4.6.1 (iii).
Therefore in ethane C-—C bond length is 154
pm and each C-H bond length is 109 pm.

sp’ Hybridisation in C,H: In the formation
of ethene molecule, one of the sp’? hybrid
orbitals of carbon atom overlaps axially with
sp’ hybridised orbital of another carbon atom
to form C-—C sigma bond. While the other two
sp’ hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom are

123

used for making sp7—s sigma bond with two
hydrogen atoms. The unhybridised orbital (2p,
or 2p,) of one carbon atom overlaps sidewise
with the similar orbital of the other carbon
atom to form weak x bond, which consists of
two equal electron clouds distributed above
and below the plane of carbon and hydrogen
atoms.

Thus, in ethene molecule, the carbon-
carbon bond consists of one sp*—sp* sigma
bond and one pi (x) bond between p orbitals
which are not used in the hybridisation and
are perpendicular to the plane of molecule; the
bond length 134 pm. The C-H bond is sp*-s
sigma with bond length 108 pm. The H—C-H
bond angle is 117.6° while the H—-C-C angle
is 121°. The formation of sigma and pi bonds
in ethene is shown in Fig. 4.15.

o bonds. Each of the two unhybridised p
orbitals of both the carbon atoms overlaps
sidewise to form two zm bonds between the
carbon atoms. So the triple bond between the
two carbon atoms is made up of one sigma
and two pi bonds as shown in Fig. 4.16.

4.6.3 Hybridisation of Elements
involving d Orbitals

The elements present in the third period
contain d orbitals in addition to s and p
orbitals. The energy of the 3d orbitals are
comparable to the energy of the 3s and 3p
orbitals. The energy of 3d orbitals are also
comparable to those of 4s and 4p orbitals.
As aconsequence the hybridisation involving
either 3s, 3p and 3d or 3d, 4s and 4p is
possible. However, since the difference in
energies of 3p and 4s orbitals is significant, no
hybridisation involving 3p, 3d and 4s orbitals
is possible.

The important hybridisation schemes
involving s, p and d orbitals are summarised
below:

molecule

It should be noted that all the bond angles
in trigonal bipyramidal geometry are not
equivalent. In PCl, the five sp’d orbitals of
phosphorus overlap with the singly occupied
p orbitals of chlorine atoms to form five P—Cl
sigma bonds. Three P-Cl bond lie in one
plane and make an angle of 120° with each
other; these bonds are termed as equatorial
bonds. The remaining two P-Cl bonds-—one
lying above and the other lying below the
equatorial plane, make an angle of 90° with
the plane. These bonds are called axial bonds.
As the axial bond pairs suffer more repulsive
interaction from the equatorial bond pairs,
therefore axial bonds have been found to
be slightly longer and hence slightly weaker
than the equatorial bonds; which makes PCl,
molecule more reactive.

(ii) Formation of SF, (sp°d? hybridisation):
In SF, the central sulphur atom has the
ground state outer electronic configuration
3s73p*. In the exited state the available six
orbitals t.e., one s, three p and two d are
singly occupied by electrons. These orbitals
hybridise to form six new sp%d? hybrid
orbitals, which are projected towards the six
corners of a regular octahedron in SF,. These

125

six sp°d* hybrid orbitals overlap with singly
occupied orbitals of fluorine atoms to form
six S-F sigma bonds. Thus SF, molecule has
a regular octahedral geometry as shown in

4.7 MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY

Molecular orbital (MO) theory was developed
by F. Hund and R.S. Mulliken in 1932. The
salient features of this theory are :

(i) |The electrons in a molecule are present
in the various molecular orbitals as the
electrons of atoms are present in the
various atomic orbitals.

(ii) The atomic orbitals of comparable
energies and proper symmetry combine
to form molecular orbitals.

(iii) While an electron in an atomic orbital
is influenced by one nucleus, in a
molecular orbital it is influenced by
two or more nuclei depending upon the
number of atoms in the molecule. Thus,

Reprint 2025-26

9/12/2022 9:36:17 AM

Unit 4.indd 126

an atomic orbital is monocentric while
a molecular orbital is polycentric.

(iv) The number of molecular orbital formed
is equal to the number of combining
atomic orbitals. When two atomic
orbitals combine, two molecular orbitals
are formed. One is known as bonding
molecular orbital while the other is
called antibonding molecular orbital.

(v) The bonding molecular orbital has
lower energy and hence greater stability
than the corresponding antibonding
molecular orbital.

(vi) Just as the electron probability
distribution around a nucleus in an
atom is given by an atomic orbital, the
electron probability distribution around
a group of nuclei in a molecule is given
by a molecular orbital.

(vii) The molecular orbitals like atomic
orbitals are filled in accordance with
the aufbau principle obeying the Pauli’s
exclusion principle and the Hund’s rule.

4.7.1 Formation of Molecular .Orbitals
Linear Combination of Atomic
Orbitals (LCAO)

According to wave mechanics, the atomic
orbitals can be expressed by wave functions
(y ’s) which represent the amplitude of the
electron waves. These are obtained from
the solution of Schrédinger wave equation.
However, since it cannot be solved for any
system containing more than one electron,
molecular orbitals which are one electron
wave functions for molecules are difficult
to obtain directly from the solution of
Schrédinger wave equation. To overcome
this problem, an approximate method known
as linear combination of atomic orbitals
(LCAO) has been adopted.

Let us apply this method to the
homonuclear diatomic hydrogen molecule.
Consider the hydrogen molecule consisting
of two atoms A and B. Each hydrogen atom
in the ground state has one electron in 1s
orbital. The atomic orbitals of these atoms
may be represented by the wave functions

CHEMISTRY

y, and y,. Mathematically, the formation of
molecular orbitals may be described by the
linear combination of atomic orbitals that can
take place by addition and by subtraction of
wave functions of individual atomic orbitals
as shown below :

Wuio ~ Va + We
Therefore, the two molecular orbitals
o and o*% are formed as:

CO = Wt YW,
w= Ya We

The molecular orbital o formed by the
addition of atomic orbitals is called the bonding
molecular orbital while the molecular orbital
o* formed by the subtraction of atomic orbital
is called antibonding molecular orbital as
depicted in Fig. 4.19.

respectively.

Qualitatively, the formation of molecular
orbitals can be understood in terms of the
constructive or destructive interference of the
electron waves of the combining atoms. In the
formation of bonding molecular orbital, the
two electron waves of the bonding atoms
reinforce each other due to constructive
interference while in the formation of

Unit 4.indd 127

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

antibonding molecular orbital, the electron
waves cancel each other due to destructive
interference. As a result, the electron density in
a bonding molecular orbital is located between
the nuclei of the bonded atoms because of
which the repulsion between the nuclei is very
less while in case of an antibonding molecular
orbital, most of the electron density is located
away from the space between the nuclei.
Infact, there is a nodal plane (on which the
electron density is zero) between the nuclei
and hence the repulsion between the nuclei is
high. Electrons placed in a bonding molecular
orbital tend to hold the nuclei together and
stabilise a molecule. Therefore, a bonding
molecular orbital always possesses lower
energy than either of the atomic orbitals that
have combined to form it. In contrast, the
electrons placed in the antibonding molecular
orbital destabilise the molecule. This is
because the mutual repulsion of the electrons
in this orbital is more than the attraction
between the electrons and the nuclei, which
causes a net increase in energy.

It may be noted that the energy of the
antibonding orbital is raised above the
energy of the parent atomic orbitals that
have combined and the energy of the bonding
orbital has been lowered than the parent
orbitals. The total energy of two molecular
orbitals, however, remains the same as that
of two original atomic orbitals.

4.7.2 Conditions for the Combination of
Atomic Orbitals

The linear combination of atomic orbitals to
form molecular orbitals takes place only if the
following conditions are satisfied:

1.The combining atomic orbitals must
have the same or nearly the same energy.
This means that 1s orbital can combine with
another 1s orbital but not with 2s orbital
because the energy of 2s orbital is appreciably
higher than that of 1s orbital. This is not true
if the atoms are very different.

2.The combining atomic orbitals must

have the same symmetry about the
molecular axis. By convention z-axis is taken

127

as the molecular axis. It is important to note
that atomic orbitals having same or nearly
the same energy will not combine if they do
not have the same symmetry. For example,
2p, orbital of one atom can combine with 2p,
orbital of the other atom but not with the
2p, or 2 P, orbitals because of their different
symmetries.

3.The combining atomic orbitals must
overlap to the maximum extent. Greater
the extent of overlap, the greater will be the
electron-density between the nuclei of a
molecular orbital.

4.7.3 Types of Molecular Orbitals

Molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules are
designated as o (sigma), z (pi), 6 (delta), etc.

In this nomenclature, the sigma (o)
molecular orbitals are symmetrical around
the bond-axis while pi (z) molecular orbitals
are not symmetrical. For example, the linear
combination of 1s orbitals centered on two
nuclei produces two molecular orbitals which
are symmetrical around the bond-axis. Such
molecular orbitals are of the o type and are
designated as ols and o* 1s |Fig. 4.20(a), page
124]. If internuclear axis is taken to be in
the z-direction, it can be seen that a linear
combination of 2p - orbitals of two atoms
also produces two sigma molecular orbitals
designated as o2p, and o*2p.. [Fig. 4.20(b)|

Molecular orbitals obtained from 2p, and
2p, orbitals are not symmetrical around the
bond axis because of the presence of positive
lobes above and negative lobes below the
molecular plane. Such molecular orbitals,
are labelled as z and =z* [Fig. 4.20(c)]. A
z bonding MO has larger electron density
above and below the inter-nuclear axis. The
m* antibonding MO has a node between the
nuclei.

4.7.4 Energy Level Diagram for Molecular
Orbitals

We have seen that 1s atomic orbitals on two
atoms form two molecular orbitals designated
as olsand o*l1s. In the same manner, the 2s
and 2p atomic orbitals (eight atomic orbitals

energies of various molecular orbitals for O,
and F, is given below:

ols<o*Is<o 2s <o*2s <o2p,< (1 2p,=1 2p)
< (x*2p = 1 2p,) <o*2p,

However, this sequence of energy levels
of molecular orbitals is not correct for the
remaining molecules Li,, Be,, B,, C,, N,. For
instance, it has been observed experimentally
that for molecules such as B,, C,, N,, etc.
the increasing order of energies of various
molecular orbitals is

ols <o*Is<o2s<o*2s < (x2 p.= m2 p.)
<o2p, < (n*2p.. =m*2p,) < o*2p,

The important characteristic feature
of this order is that the energy of o2p,

molecular orbital is higher than that
of x2p,.and x2p, molecular orbitals.

4.7.5 Electronic Configuration and
Molecular Behaviour

The distribution of electrons among various
molecular orbitals is called the electronic
configuration of the molecule. From the
electronic configuration of the molecule, it is
possible to get important information about
the molecule as discussed below.

Stability of Molecules: If N, is the number
of electrons occupying bonding orbitals and
N, the number occupying the antibonding
orbitals, then

(i) | the molecule is stable if N, is greater
than N_, and

(ii) the molecule is unstable if N, is less
than N..

In (i) more bonding orbitals are occupied
and so the bonding influence is stronger anda
stable molecule results. In (ii) the antibonding
influence is stronger and therefore the
molecule is unstable.

Bond order
Bond order (b.o.) is defined as one half the
difference between the number of electrons

present in the bonding and the antibonding
orbitals i.e.,

Bond order (b.0.) = % (N,—-N_)

129

The rules discussed above regarding the
stability of the molecule can be restated in
terms of bond order as follows: A positive bond
order (i.e., N, > N.) means a stable molecule
while a negative (i.e., N,<N,) or zero (i.e.,
N,= N,) bond order means an unstable

b
molecule.

Nature of the bond

Integral bond order values of 1, 2 or 3
correspond to single, double or triple bonds
respectively as studied in the classical
concept.

Bond-length

The bond order between two atoms in a
molecule may be taken as an approximate
measure of the bond length. The bond length
decreases as bond order increases.

Magnetic nature

If all the molecular orbitals in a molecule are
doubly occupied, the substance is diamagnetic
(repelled by magnetic field). However if one or
more molecular orbitals are singly occupied it
is paramagnetic (attracted by magnetic field),
e.g., O, molecule.

4.8, BONDING IN SOME HOMONUCLEAR
DIATOMIC MOLECULES

In this section we shall discuss bonding in
some homonuclear diatomic molecules.

1. Hydrogen molecule (H, ): It is formed by
the combination of two hydrogen atoms. Each
hydrogen atom has one electron in 1s orbital.
Therefore, in all there are two electrons in
hydrogen molecule which are present in o/s
molecular orbital. So electronic configuration
of hydrogen molecule is

H, : (o 1s)?

The bond order of H, molecule can be
calculated as given below:
N,-N, 2-0 _ 1

2 2

This means that the two hydrogen atoms
are bonded together by a single covalent bond.
The bond dissociation energy of hydrogen
molecule has been found to be 438 kJ mol!
and bond length equal to 74 pm. Since no

unpaired electron is present in hydrogen
molecule, therefore, it is diamagnetic.

2. Helium molecule (He, ): The electronic
configuration of helium atom is 1s’. Each
helium atom contains 2 electrons, therefore,
in He, molecule there would be 4 electrons.
These electrons will be accommodated in
olsand o*ls molecular orbitals leading to
electronic configuration:

He, : (o 1s)? (o* 1s)?

2

Bond order of He, is (2 — 2) = 0

He, molecule is therefore unstable and
does not exist.

Similarly, it can be shown that Be, molecule
(01s)? (o* 1s)? (02s)? (o*2 8s)? also does not exist.

3. Lithium molecule (Li, ): The electronic
configuration of lithium is 1s’, 2s'. There
are six electrons in Li,. The electronic
configuration of Li, molecule, therefore, is

Li, : (61s)? (o*1s)? (o2s)”
The above configuration is also written

as KK(o2s)? where KK represents the closed
K shell structure (o1s)? (o*1s)?.

From the electronic configuration of Li,
molecule it is clear that there are four electrons
present in bonding molecular orbitals and two
electrons present in antibonding molecular
orbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is '/2 (4 —
2) = 1. It means that Li, molecule is stable
and since it has no unpaired electrons it
should be diamagnetic. Indeed diamagnetic
Li, molecules are known to exist in the
vapour phase.

4. Carbon molecule (C, ): The electronic
configuration of carbon is 1s? 2s? 2p’. There
are twelve electrons in C,. The electronic

configuration of C, molecule, therefore, is

C,: (61s)? (*1s) (6 * 2s)? (2p = 2p’)
or KK (02s)? (o* 2s)? (12p%, = 22p*)

The bond order of C, is % (8 — 4) = 2
and C, should be diamagnetic. Diamagnetic
C, molecules have indeed been detected in

CHEMISTRY

vapour phase. It is important to note that
double bond in C, consists of both pi bonds
because of the presence of four electrons in
two pi molecular orbitals. In most of the other
molecules a double bond is made up of a
sigma bond and a pi bond. In a similar fashion
the bonding in N, molecule can be discussed.

5S. Oxygen molecule (O,): The electronic
configuration of oxygen atom is 1s* 2s? 2p%*.
Each oxygen atom has 8 electrons, hence,
in O, molecule there are 16 electrons. The
electronic configuration of O, molecule,
therefore, is

O,: (ols)? (o*1s)? (6 2s)? (o * Qs)* (o2p,)?

From the electronic configuration of O,
molecule it is clear that ten electrons are
present in bonding molecular orbitals and six
electrons are present in antibonding molecular
orbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is

1 1
Bond order = oy [N, - N,] = > [10-6] =2

So in oxygen molecule, atoms are held
by a double bond. Moreover, it may be noted
that it contains two unpaired electrons in
m*2p and m* 2p, molecular orbitals, therefore,
O, molecule should be paramagnetic,
a prediction that corresponds to
experimental observation. In this way, the
theory successfully explains the paramagnetic
nature of oxygen.

Similarly, the electronic configurations
of other homonuclear diatomic molecules of
the second row of the periodic table can be
written. In Fig. 4.21 are given the molecular
orbital occupancy and molecular properties
for B, through Ne,. The sequence of MOs and
their electron population are shown. The bond
energy, bond length, bond order, magnetic
properties and valence electron configuration
appear below the orbital diagrams.

4.9 HYDROGEN BONDING

Nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine are the highly
electronegative elements. When they are
attached to a hydrogen atom to form covalent
bond, the electrons of the covalent bond are
shifted towards the more electronegative
atom. This partially positively charged
hydrogen atom forms a bond with the other
more electronegative atom. This bond is
known as hydrogen bond and is weaker
than the covalent bond. For example, in HF
molecule, the hydrogen bond exists between
hydrogen atom of one molecule and fluorine
atom of another molecule as depicted below :

_—_ H*—F° _ _ —H>* _ FO _ H5* _ FO
Here, hydrogen bond acts as a bridge between

two atoms which holds one atom by covalent
bond and the other by hydrogen bond.

Hydrogen bond is represented by a dotted
line (- — -) while a solid line represents the
covalent bond. Thus, hydrogen bond can be
defined as the attractive force which binds
hydrogen atom of one molecule with the
electronegative atom (F, O or N) of another
molecule.

4.9.1 Cause of Formation of Hydrogen
Bond

When hydrogen is bonded to strongly
electronegative element ‘X’, the electron pair
shared between the two atoms moves far
away from hydrogen atom. As a result the

charge (5). This results in the formation of a
polar molecule having electrostatic force of
attraction which can be represented as:

He+ — Xe — Xe tt x

The magnitude of H-bonding depends
on the physical state of the compound. It is
maximum in the solid state and minimum in
the gaseous state. Thus, the hydrogen bonds
have strong influence on the structure and
properties of the compounds.

4.9.2 Types of H-Bonds

There are two types of H-bonds

(i) Intermolecular hydrogen bond
(ii) Intramolecular hydrogen bond

(1) Intermolecular hydrogen bond : It is
formed between two different molecules of the
same or different compounds. For example,

CHEMISTRY

H-bond in case of HF molecule, alcohol or
water molecules, etc.

(2) Intramolecular hydrogen bond : It is
formed when hydrogen atom is in between
the two highly electronegative (F, O, N)
atoms present within the same molecule. For
example, in o-nitrophenol the hydrogen is in
between the two oxygen atoms.

SUMMARY

K6ssel’s first insight into the mechanism of formation of electropositive and electronegative
ions related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by the respective ions.
Electrostatic attraction between ions is the cause for their stability. This gives the concept

of electrovalency.

The first description of covalent bonding was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing
of electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas
configurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols
show the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures
show pictorial representations of bonding in molecules.

An ionic compound is pictured as a three-dimensional aggregation of positive and negative
ions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a
charge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by

the enthalpy of lattice formation.

While a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms,
multiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms
have additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding. These are called lone-pairs of
electrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around
each atom in a molecule. Important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like:
bond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant

effect on the properties of compounds.

A number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single
Lewis structure and a number of descriptions (representations) based on the same skeletal
structure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very
important and extremely useful concept called resonance. The contributing structures
or canonical forms taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the

molecule or ion.

CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

The VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on
the assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far
apart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions
between lone pairs and lone pairs; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and bonding
pairs. The order of these repulsions being: lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp

The valence bond (VB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the
energetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent.
Basically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example
the formation of the H, molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s
orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy
of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium
inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring
the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization
of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases
which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and
bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken
into account.

For explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the
concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp, sp’, sp’ hybridizations of atomic orbitals
of Be, B, C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules
like BeCl,, BCl,, CH,, NH, and H,O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in
molecules like C,H, and C,H,.

The molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and
arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule
as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic
orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density
between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding
molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more
energy than the individual atomic orbitals.

The electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular
orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion
principle and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are
said to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that
in antibonding molecular orbitals.

Hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly
electronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two
or more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within
the same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties
of many compounds.
