LINEAR INEQUALITIES

“* Mathematics is the art of saying many things in many
different ways. - MAXWELL**

5.1 Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied equations in one variable and two variables and also
solved some statement problems by translating them in the form of equations. Now a
natural question arises: ‘Is it always possible to translate a statement problem in the
form of an equation? For example, the height of all the students in your class is less
than 160 cm. Your classroom can occupy atmost 60 tables or chairs or both. Here we
get certain statements involving a sign ‘<’ (less than), ‘>’ (greater than), ‘<’ (less than
or equal) and = (greater than or equal) which are known as inequalities.

In this Chapter, we will study linear inequalities in one and two variables. The
study of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics,
statistics, economics, psychology, etc.

5.2 Inequalities

Let us consider the following situations:

(1) Ravi goes to market with % 200 to buy rice, which is available in packets of 1kg. The
price of one packet of rice is ¥30. If x denotes the number of packets of rice, which he
buys, then the total amount spent by him is %30x. Since, he has to buy rice in packets
only, he may not be able to spend the entire amount of ¥ 200. (Why?) Hence

30x < 200 . (1)

Clearly the statement (i) is not an equation as it does not involve the sign of equality.

(11) Reshma has % 120 and wants to buy some registers and pens. The cost of one
register is 40 and that of a pen is % 20. In this case, if x denotes the number of
registers and y, the number of pens which Reshma buys, then the total amount spent by
her is (40x + 20y) and we have

40x + 20y < 120 .. (2)

Since in this case the total amount spent may be upto ¥ 120. Note that the statement (2)
consists of two statements

40x + 20y < 120 . B)
and 40x + 20y = 120 . (4)

Statement (3) is not an equation, i.e., it is an inequality while statement (4) is an equation.

Definition | Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbol
“<?, >’, “<<? or ‘2’ form an inequality.
Statements such as (1), (2) and (3) above are inequalities.

3 <5; 7>5 are the examples of numerical inequalities while
x<5;y>2;x = 3, y< 4 are some examples of /iteral inequalities.

3 <5 <7 (read as 5 is greater than 3 and less than 7), 3 < x <5 (read as x is greater
than or equal to 3 and less than 5) and 2 <y<4 are the examples of double inequalities.

Some more examples of inequalities are:

ax +b<0 .. (5)
ax +b>0 ... (6)
ax +b<0 (7)
ax +b20 ... (8)
ax + by <ce .. (9)
ax + by>e .. (10)
ax + by<e .. 1)
ax + by> c¢ .. (12)
ax? + bx +c<0 .. (13)
ax’ + bx +e>0 .. (14)

Inequalities (5), (6), (9), (10) and (14) are strict inequalities while inequalities (7), (8),
(11), (12), and (13) are slack inequalities. Inequalities from (5) to (8) are linear
inequalities in one variable x when a #0, while inequalities from (9) to (12) are linear
inequalities in two variables x and y when a #0, b #0.

Inequalities (13) and (14) are not linear (in fact, these are quadratic inequalities
in one variable x when a # 0).

In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of linear inequalities in one
and two variables only.

5.3 Algebraic Solutions of Linear Inequalities in One Variable and their
Graphical Representation

Let us consider the inequality (1) of Section 6.2, viz, 30x < 200
Note that here x denotes the number of packets of rice.

Obviously, x cannot be a negative integer or a fraction. Left hand side (L.H.S.) of this
inequality is 30x and right hand side (RHS) is 200. Therefore, we have

For x = 0, L.H.S. = 30 (0) = 0 < 200 (R.H.S.), which is true.
For x = 1, L.H.S. = 30 (1) = 30 < 200 (R.HLS.), which is true.
For x = 2, L.H.S. = 30 (2) = 60 < 200, which is true.

For x = 3, L.H.S. = 30 (3) = 90 < 200, which is true.

For x = 4, L.H.S. = 30 (4) = 120 < 200, which is true.

For x = 5, L.H.S. = 30 (5) = 150 < 200, which is true.

For x = 6, L.H.S. = 30 (6) = 180 < 200, which is true.

For x = 7, L.H.S. = 30 (7) = 210 < 200, which is false.

In the above situation, we find that the values of x, which makes the above
inequality a true statement, are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. These values of x, which make above
inequality a true statement, are called solutions of inequality and the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
is called its solution set.

Thus, any solution of an inequality in one variable is a value of the variable
which makes it a true statement.

We have found the solutions of the above inequality by trial and error method
which is not very efficient. Obviously, this method is time consuming and sometimes
not feasible. We must have some better or systematic techniques for solving inequalities.
Before that we should go through some more properties of numerical inequalities and
follow them as rules while solving the inequalities.

You will recall that while solving linear equations, we followed the following rules:

Rule 1 Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an equation.

Rule 2 Both sides of an equation may be multiplied (or divided) by the same non-zero
number.

In the case of solving inequalities, we again follow the same rules except with a
difference that in Rule 2, the sign of inequality is reversed (1.e., “<‘ becomes ‘>’, <’
becomes ‘>’ and so on) whenever we multiply (or divide) both sides of an inequality by
a negative number. It is evident from the facts that

3 > 2 while —3 <—2,
— 8 <-7 while (- 8) (2) > 7) (2),1¢., 16> 14.

92 MATHEMATICS

Thus, we state the following rules for solving an inequality:

Rule | Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an inequality
without affecting the sign of inequality.

Rule 2 Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied (or divided) by the same positive
number. But when both sides are multiplied or divided by a negative number, then the
sign of inequality is reversed.

Now, let us consider some examples.

Example 1 Solve 30 x < 200 when

(1) x is a natural number, (11) x is an integer.
Solution We are given 30 x < 200

30x 70) Rule 2), ie, ¥< 20/3
30 ~ 30 (Rule 2), i.e., x .

(i) When x isa natural number, in this case the following values of x make the
statement true.
1,2,3,4, 5, 6.
The solution set of the inequality is {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
(ii) When xis an integer, the solutions of the given inequality are
5 —3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
The solution set of the inequality is {....-3, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6}

Example 2 Solve 5x - 3 < 3x +1 when

(i) xis an integer, (ii) x is a real number.
Solution We have, 5x —3 < 3x + 1
or 5x-3+3<3x+143 (Rule 1)
or 5x<3x+4
or 5x-—3x<3x+4—-3x (Rule 1)
or 2x<4
or x<2 (Rule 2)

(i) When xis an integer, the solutions of the given inequality are
5 —4,-3,-2,-1,0, 1
(ii) When xis areal number, the solutions of the inequality are given by x <2,
i.e., all real numbers x which are less than 2. Therefore, the solution set of
the inequality is x € (— ©, 2).
We have considered solutions of inequalities in the set of natural numbers, set of
integers and in the set of real numbers. Henceforth, unless stated otherwise, we shall
solve the inequalities in this Chapter in the set of real numbers.

Example 3 Solve 4x + 3 < 6x +7.

Solution We have, 4x+3<6x+7
or Ax — 6x < 6x + 4 — 6x
or —~2x<4 or x>-2

i.e., all the real numbers which are greater than —2, are the solutions of the given
inequality. Hence, the solution set is (—2, 0).

or 2(5-—2x) < x-30.
or 10 -4x <x-30
or —5x<-40, ie, x = 8

Thus, all real numbers x which are greater than or equal to 8 are the solutions of the
given inequality, i.e., x € [8, 0).

Example 7 The marks obtained by a student of Class XI in first and second terminal

examination are 62 and 48, respectively. Find the minimum marks he should get in the
annual examination to have an average of at least 60 marks.

Solution Let x be the marks obtained by student in the annual examination. Then

624+ 484% . 64
3
or 110+x => 180
or x = 70

Thus, the student must obtain a minimum of 70 marks to get an average of at least
60 marks.

Example 8 Find all pairs of consecutive odd natural numbers, both of which are larger
than 10, such that their sum is less than 40.

Solution Let x be the smaller of the two consecutive odd natural number, so that the
other one is x +2. Then, we should have

x>10 (1)
and x+(x+2)<40 .. (2)
Solving (2), we get

2x+2<40
ie, x< 19 ... (3)
From (1) and (3), we get

10<x<19

Since x is an odd number, x can take the values 11, 13, 15, and 17. So, the required
possible pairs will be

(11, 13), (13, 15), (15, 17), (17, 19)
