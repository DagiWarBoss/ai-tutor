10.1. Introduction

In the preceding Chapter 10, we have studied various forms
of the equations of a line. In this Chapter, we shall study
about some other curves, viz., circles, ellipses, parabolas
and hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are
given by Apollonius. These curves are in fact, known as
conic sections or more commonly conics because they
can be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double
napped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide

range of applications in fields such as planetary motion, Apollonius
design of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in flashlights (262 B.C. -190 B.C.)
and automobile headlights, etc. Now, in the subsequent sections we will see how the
intersection of a plane with a double napped right circular cone
results in different types of curves.

10.2. Sections of a Cone

Let / bea fixed vertical line and m be another line intersecting it at

a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle o (Fig10.1).
Suppose we rotate the line m around the line / in such a way

that the angle a remains constant. Then the surface generated is

a double-napped right circular hollow cone herein after referred as Fig 10.1

cone and extending indefinitely far in both directions (Fig10.2).

The point V is called the vertex; the line /1s the axis of the cone. The rotating line
m is called a generator of the cone. The vertex separates the cone into two parts
called nappes.

If we take the intersection of a plane with a cone, the section so obtained is called
a conic section. Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a right
circular cone by a plane.

We obtain different kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the
intersecting plane with respect to the cone and by the angle made by it with the vertical
axis of the cone. Let B be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical
axis of the cone (Fig10.3).

The intersection of the plane with the cone can take place either at the vertex of
the cone or at any other part of the nappe either below or above the vertex.

10.2.1 Circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola When the plane cuts the nappe (other
than the vertex) of the cone, we have the following situations:

(a) When B=90°, the section is a circle (Fig10.4).

(b) When a << 90°, the section is an ellipse (Fig10.5).

(c) When B =; the section is a parabola (Fig10.6).

(In each of the above three situations, the plane cuts entirely across one nappe of
the cone).

(d) When 0 < 8 <q; the plane cuts through both the nappes and the curves of
intersection is a hyperbola (Fig10.7).

10.2.2 Degenerated/conic sections

When the plane cuts at the vertex of the cone, we have the following different cases:

(a) When a<f< 90°, then the section is a point (Fig10.8).

(b) When B = a, the plane contains a generator of the cone and the section is a
straight line (Fig10.9).

It is the degenerated case of a parabola.

(c) When 0 < B <a, the section is a pair of intersecting straight lines (Fig10.10).
It is the degenerated case of a hyperbola.

sections in standard form by defining them based on geometric properties.

10.3 Circle
Definition 1 A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed

point in the plane.
The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and the distance from the centre
to a point on the circle is called the radius of the circle (Fig 10.11).

The equation of the circle is simplest if the centre of the circle is at the origin.
However, we derive below the equation of the circle with a given centre and radius
(Fig 10.12).

Given C (h, k) be the centre and r the radius of circle. Let P(x, v) be any point on
the circle (Fig10.12). Then, by the definition, | CP | = 7. By the distance formula,

we have
i.e. (x-hyp+y-kp=r
This is the required equation of the circle with centre at (,k) and radius r .
Example | Find an equation of the circle with centre at (0,0) and radius r.
Solution Here h=k=0. Therefore, the equation of the circle is x7 + =r’.
Example 2 Find the equation of the circle with centre (—3, 2) and radius 4.
Solution Here h =-3, k= 2 and r= 4. Therefore, the equation of the required circle is
(x + 3)? + (vy -2)? = 16
Example 3 Find the centre and the radius of the circle x° + y?+ 8x + 10y-—8 =0
Solution The given equation is
(x° + 8x) +67 + 10y) = 8
Now, completing the squares within the parenthesis, we get
(x° + 8x + 16) + G2 + 10y + 25) =8 + 16+ 25
i.e. (x+ 47+ (y+ 57? =49
i.e. {fx-(-4)P + yp -GS)P =P

Therefore, the given circle has centre at (— 4, —5) and radius 7.

(3,4) and whose centre lies on the line x + y= 2.
Solution Let the equation of the circle be (x — Ay + (vy —ky =r’.

Since the circle passes through (2, — 2) and (3,4), we have

10.4 Parabola

Definition 2 A parabola is the set of all points

ina plane that are equidistant from a fixed line

and a fixed point (not on the line) in the plane.

The fixed line is called the directrix of

the parabola and the fixed point F is called the

focus (Fig 10.13). (‘Para’ means ‘for’ and
‘bola’ means ‘throwing’, i.e., the shape

described when you throw a ball in the air).

If the fixed point lies on the fixed

line, then the set of points in the plane, which
are equidistant from the fixed point and the

fixed line is the straight line through the fixed
point and perpendicular to the fixed line. We
call this straight line as degenerate case of
the parabola.

A line through the focus and perpendicular
to the directrix is called the axis of the
parabola. The point of intersection of parabola
with the axis is called the vertex of the parabola
(Fig10.14).

10.4.1 Standard equations of parabola
The equation of a parabola is simplest if the

Fig 10.15 (a) to (d) (d)

We will derive the equation for the parabola shown above in Fig 10.15 (a) with
focus at (a, 0) a> 0; and directricx x =— a as below:
Let F be the focus and / the directrix. Let
FM be perpendicular to the directrix and bisect
FM at the point O. Produce MO to X. By the (-4,¥)B
definition of parabola, the mid-point O is on the
parabola and is called the vertex of the parabola.
Take O as origin, OX the x-axis and OY
perpendicular to it as the y-axis. Let the distance
from the directrix to the focus be 2a. Then, the
coordinates of the focus are (a, 0), and the
equation of the directrix is x + a=0.as in Fig10.16.
Let P(x, y) be any point on the parabola such that Fig 10.16

PF = PB, (Il)
where PB is perpendicular to /. The coordinates of B are (— a, y). By the distance
formula, we have

PF = [e—-aP +y? and PB= [ie 4a)?

Since PF = PB, we have

J(x—a)y +y? =s/(x+ay

ie. (x-ayvty=(x+ ay
or x -—2axt+aet+y=x4+2axt+a

or y=4ax(a> 0).

Hence, any point on the parabola satisfies
y = 4ax. >)

Conversely, let P(x, y) satisfy the equation (2)

PF = V(aw-ay+y? = V(x —a)* + 4ax
= J(x+a) =PB . 3)

and so P(x,y) lies on the parabola.

Thus, from (2) and (3) we have proved that the equation to the parabola with
vertex at the origin, focus at (a,0) and directrix x =— a is y? = 4ax.

Discussion In equation (2), since a> 0, x can assume any positive value or zero but
no negative value and the curve extends indefinitely far into the first and the fourth
quadrants. The axis of the parabola is the positive x-axis.

Similarly, we can derive the equations of the parabolas in:

Fig 11.15 (b) as Y =-— 4ax,
Fig 11.15 (c) as x? = 4ay,
Fig 11.15 (d) as x? = — 4ay,

These four equations are known as standard equations of parabolas.

The standard equations of parabolas have focus on one of the coordinate
axis; vertex at the origin and thereby the directrix is parallel to the other coordinate

axis. However, the study of the equations of parabolas with focus at any point and
any line as directrix is beyond the scope here.

From the standard equations of the parabolas, Fig10.15, we have the following
observations:

1.  Parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola. If the equation
has a y’ term, then the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis and if the
equation has an x* term, then the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis.

2. When the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis the parabola opens to the
(a) right if the coefficient of x is positive,

(b) left if the coefficient of x is negative.

3. | When the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis the parabola opens
(c) upwards if the coefficient of y is positive.

(d) downwards if the coefficient of y is negative.

10.4.2 Latus rectum

Definition 3 Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of
the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola (Fig10.17).
To find the Length of the latus rectum of the parabola y’ = 4ax (Fig 10.18).
By the definition of the parabola, AF = AC.
But AC = FM = 2a
Hence AF = 2a.
And since the parabola is symmetric with respect to x-axis AF = FB and so

AB = Length of the latus rectum = 4a.

Example 5 Find the coordinates of the focus, axis,
the equation of the directrix and latus rectum of
the parabola y” = 8x.

Solution The given equation involves y’, so the
axis of symmetry is along the x-axis.

The coefficient of x is positive so the parabola opens
to the right. Comparing with the given equation
y = 4ax, we find that a = 2. Fig 10.19

Thus, the focus of the parabola is (2, 0) and the equation of the directrix of the parabola
is x =— 2 (Fig 10.19).

Length of the latus rectum is 4a =4 x 2=8.

Example 6 Find the equation of the parabola with focus (2,0) and directrix x = — 2.

Solution Since the focus (2,0) lies on the x-axis, the x-axis itself is the axis of the

parabola. Hence the equation of the parabola is of the form either

y= 4ax or y =— 4ax. Since the directrix is x =— 2 and the focus is (2,0), the parabola

is to be of the form y? = 4ax with a = 2. Hence the required equation is
y? = 4(2)x = 8x

Example 7 Find the equation of the parabola with vertex at (0, 0) and focus at (0, 2).

Solution Since the vertex is at (0,0) and the focus is at (0,2) which lies on y-axis, the
y-axis is the axis of the parabola. Therefore, equation of the parabola is of the form
x? = 4ay. thus, we have

x? = 4(2)y, ie., x? = By.
Example 8 Find the equation of the parabola which is symmetric about the y-axis, and
passes through the point (2,—3).

Solution Since the parabola is symmetric about y-axis and has its vertex at the origin,
the equation is of the form x? = 4ay or x? =— 4ay, where the sign depends on whether
the parabola opens upwards or downwards. But the parabola passes through (2,—3)
which lies in the fourth quadrant, it must open downwards. Thus the equation is of
the form x? = — 4ay.

Since the parabola passes through ( 2,—3), we have

P =—4a(3),ie,a = 5

Therefore, the equation of the parabola is

Definition 4 An ellipse is the set ofall pointsin iP, ND
a plane, the sum of whose distances from two </>
fixed points in the plane is a constant. \> <S\

The two fixed points are called the foci (plural
of ‘focus’) of the ellipse (Fig10.20).

The constant which is the sum of
the distances of a point on the ellipse from the

P,F,+ P,F,= P,F,+ P,F,= PF, + P,F,
two fixed points is always greater than the Fig 10.20
distance between the two fixed points.

The mid point of the line segment joining the foci is called the centre of the
ellipse. The line segment through the foci of the ellipse is called the major axis and the
line segment through the centre and perpendicular to the major axis 1s called the minor
axis. The end points of the major axis are called the vertices of the ellipse(Fig 10.21).

major and minor axis are coordinate axes. However, the study of the ellipses with

centre at any other point, and any line through the centre as major and the minor
axes passing through the centre and perpendicular to major axis are beyond the
scope here.

From the standard equations of the ellipses (Fig10.24), we have the following
observations:

1. Ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the coordinate axes since if
(x, y) is a point on the ellipse, then (— x, y), (x, —v) and (— x, —y) are also points on
the ellipse.

2. The foci always lie on the major axis. The major axis can be determined by
finding the intercepts on the axes of symmetry. That is, major axis is along the x-axis
if the coefficient of x? has the larger denominator and it is along the y-axis if the
coefficient of y’ has the larger denominator.

distances from two fixed points in the plane is a constant.

Fig 10.27

The term “difference” that is used in the definition means the distance to the
farther point minus the distance to the closer point. The two fixed points are called the
foci of the hyperbola. The mid-point of the line segment joining the foci is called the
centre of the hyperbola. The line through the foci is called the transverse axis and
the line through the centre and perpendicular to the transverse axis is called the conjugate
axis. The points at which the hyperbola
intersects the transverse axis are called the
vertices of the hyperbola (Fig 10.27).

We denote the distance between the
two foci by 2c, the distance between two xX’
vertices (the length of the transverse axis)
by 2a and we define the quantity b as

b = fea

Also 26 is the length of the conjugate axis
(Fig 10.28).

10.6.1 Eccentricity

c
Definition 8 Just like an ellipse, the ratio e = a is called the eccentricity of the

hyperbola. Since c = a, the eccentricity is never less than one. In terms of the
eccentricity, the foci are at a distance of ae from the centre.

10.6.2 Standard equation of Hyperbola The equation of a hyperbola is simplest if
the centre of the hyperbola is at the origin and the foci are on the x-axis or y-axis. The
two such possible orientations are shown in Fig10.29.

We will derive the equation for the hyperbola shown in Fig 10.29(a) with foci on
the x-axis.

Let F, and F, be the foci and O be the mid-point of the line segment F,F,. Let O
be the origin and the line through O
through F, be the positive x-axis and
that through F, as the negative
x-axis. The line through O
perpendicular to the x-axis be the
y-axis. Let the coordinates of F, be x”
(—c,0) and F, be (c,0) (Fig 10.30).

Let P(x, y) be any point on the
hyperbola such that the difference
of the distances from P to the farther
point minus the closer point be 2a.

These two equations are known as the standard equations of hyperbolas.

The standard equations of hyperbolas have transverse and conjugate
axes as the coordinate axes and the centre at the origin. However, there are

hyperbolas with any two perpendicular lines as transverse and conjugate axes, but
the study of such cases will be dealt in higher classes.

From the standard equations of hyperbolas (Fig10.27), we have the following
observations:

1. Hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both the axes, since if (x, y) is a point on
the hyperbola, then (—x, y), (x, —) and (—x, —y) are also points on the hyperbola.

Example 17 The focus of a parabolic mirror as shown in Fig 10.31 is at a distance of
5 cm from its vertex. If the mirror is 45 cm deep, find Y
the distance AB (Fig 10.31).

Solution Since the distance from the focus to the
vertex is 5 cm. We have, a= 5. If the origin is taken at
the vertex and the axis of the mirror lies along the
positive x-axis, the equation of the parabolic section is
y=4(5)x=20x

Note that x =45. Thus
y = 900
Therefore y= +30

Historical Note

Geometry is one of the most ancient branches of mathematics. The Greek
geometers investigated the properties of many curves that have theoretical and
practical importance. Euclid wrote his treatise on geometry around 300 B.C. He
was the first who organised the geometric figures based on certain axioms
suggested by physical considerations. Geometry as initially studied by the ancient
Indians and Greeks, who made essentially no use of the process of algebra. The
synthetic approach to the subject of geometry as given by Euclid and in
Sulbasutras, etc., was continued for some 1300 years. In the 200 B.C., Apollonius
wrote a book called ‘The Conic’ which was all about conic sections with many
important discoveries that have remained unsurpassed for eighteen centuries.

Modern analytic geometry is called ‘Cartesian’ after the name of Rene
Descartes (1596-1650) whose relevant ‘La Geometrie’ was published in 1637.
But the fundamental principle and method of analytical geometry were already
discovered by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Unfortunately, Fermats treatise on
the subject, entitled Ad Locus Planos et So LIDOS Isagoge (Introduction to
Plane and Solid Loci) was published only posthumously in
1679. So, Descartes came to be regarded as the unique inventor of the analytical
geometry.

Isaac Barrow avoided using cartesian method. Newton used method of
undetermined coefficients to find equations of curves. He used several types of
coordinates including polar and bipolar. Leibnitz used the terms ‘abscissa’,
‘ordinate’ and ‘coordinate’. L’ Hospital (about 1700) wrote an important textbook
on analytical geometry.

Clairaut (1729) was the first to give the distance formula although in clumsy
form. He also gave the intercept form of the linear equation. Cramer (1750)
