Where there is oxidation, there is always reduction -
Chemistry is essentially a study of redox systems.

Chemistry deals with varieties of matter and change
of one kind of matter into the other. Transformation of
matter from one kind into another occurs through the
various types of reactions. One important category of such
reactions is Redox Reactions. A number of phenomena,
both physical as well as biological, are concerned with
redox reactions. These reactions find extensive use in
pharmaceutical, biological, industrial, metallurgical and
agricultural areas. The importance of these reactions is
apparent from the fact that burning of different types of
fuels for obtaining energy for domestic, transport and
other commercial purposes, electrochemical processes
for extraction of highly reactive metals and non-metals,
manufacturing of chemical compounds like caustic
soda, operation of dry and wet batteries and corrosion of
metals fall within the purview of redox processes. Of late,
environmental issues like Hydrogen Economy (use of
liquid hydrogen as fuel) and development of ‘Ozone Hole’
have started figuring under redox phenomenon.

7.1 CLASSICAL IDEA OF REDOX REACTIONS -
OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS

Originally, the term oxidation was used to describe the
addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because
of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere (~20%),
many elements combine with it and this is the principal
reason why they commonly occur on the earth in the
form of their oxides. The following reactions represent
oxidation processes according to the limited definition of
oxidation:

2 Mg (s) + O, (g) — 2 MgO (s)

S (s) + 0, (g) > SO,

(7.1)
(7.2)

In reactions (7.1) and (7.2), the elements
magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on
account of addition of oxygen to them.
Similarly, methane is oxidised owing to the
addition of oxygen to it.

CH, (g) + 20, (g) — CO, (g) + 2H,O (I) (7.3)
A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in
which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen
prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation
in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and,
therefore, the scope of term oxidation was
broadened to include the removal of hydrogen
from a substance. The following illustration is
another reaction where removal of hydrogen
can also be cited as an oxidation reaction.

2 H,S(g) + O, (9) ~2S(s)+2H,O() (7.4)

As knowledge of chemists grew, it was
natural to extend the term oxidation for
reactions similar to (7.1 to 7.4), which do
not involve oxygen but other electronegative
elements. The oxidation of magnesium with
fluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs
according to the following reactions :

Mg (s) + F, (g) — MgF, (s) (7.5)
Mg (s) + Cl, (g) ~ MgCl, (s) (7.6)
Mg (s) + S (s) — MgsS (s) (7.7)

Incorporating the reactions (7.5 to
7.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions
encouraged chemists to consider not only
the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but
also the removal of electropositive elements
as oxidation. Thus the reaction :

2K, [Fe(CN),](aq) + H,O, (aq) —>2K,[Fe(CN),](aq)

+ 2 KOH (aq)
is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal
of electropositive element potassium from
potassium ferrocyanide before it changes to
potassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the
term “oxidation” is defined as the addition
of oxygen/electronegative element to
a substance or removal of hydrogen/
electropositive element from a substance.

In the beginning, reduction was considered
as removal of oxygen from a compound.
However, the term reduction has been

CHEMISTRY

broadened these days to include removal
of oxygen/electronegative element from
a substance or addition of hydrogen/
electropositive element to a substance._

According to the definition given above,
the following are the examples of reduction
processes:

2 HgO (s) “> 2 Hg (1) + 0,8) (7.8)

(removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )

2 FeCl, (aq) + H, (g) 2 FeCl, (aq) + 2 HCl(aq)

(7.9)

(removal of electronegative element, chlorine

from ferric chloride)

CH, = CH, (g) + H, (g) > H,C — CH, (g) (7.10)

(addition of hydrogen)

2HgCl, (aq) + SnCl, (aq) > Hg,Cl, (s)+SnCl, (aq)
(7.11)

(addition of mercury to mercuric chloride)

In reaction (7.11) simultaneous oxidation
of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is
also occurring because of the addition of
electronegative element chlorine to it. It was
soon realised that oxidation and reduction
always occur simultaneously (as will be
apparent by re-examining all the equations

given above), hence, the word “redox” was
coined for this class of chemical reactions.

Problem 7.1

In the reactions given below, identify
the species undergoing oxidation and
reduction:

(i) H,S (g) + Cl, (g) > 2 HCl (g) + S (s)
(ii) 3Fe,O, (s) + 8 Al (s) > 9 Fe (s)

+ 4A1,0, (s)
(iii) 2 Na (s) + H, (g) — 2 NaH (s)

Solution

(i) H,S is oxidised because a more
electronegative element, chlorine is added
to hydrogen (or a more electropositive
element, hydrogen has been removed
from S). Chlorine is reduced due to
addition of hydrogen to it.

(ii) Aluminium is oxidised because
oxygen is added to it. Ferrous ferric oxide

REDOX REACTIONS

(Fe,O,) is reduced because oxygen has
been removed from it.

(iii) With the careful application of the
concept of electronegativity only we
may infer that sodium is oxidised and
hydrogen is reduced.

Reaction (iii) chosen here prompts us to
think in terms of another way to define
redox reactions.

7.2 REDOX REACTIONS IN TERMS OF
ELECTRON TRANSFER REACTIONS

We have already learnt that the reactions

2Na(s) + Cl,(g) — 2NaCl (s) (7.12)
4Na(s) + O,(g) — 2Na,O(s) (7.13)
2Na(s) + S(s) — Na,S(s) (7.14)

are redox reactions because in each of these
reactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition
of either oxygen or more electronegative
element to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine,
oxygen and sulphur are reduced because to
each of these, the electropositive element
sodium has been added. From our knowledge
of chemical bonding we also know that sodium
chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide
are ionic compounds and perhaps better
written as Na‘Cl (s), (Na*),O7(s), and (Na*),
S*(s). Development of charges on the species
produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions
(7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner :

loss of 2e—
2Na(s) + Cl,(g) —~ 2Na Cl (s)

gain of 2e€
loss of 2e”

2Na(s) + O, (g) —> (Na‘), O* (s)
gain of 2e€
loss of 2&
2Na(s) + S(s) —— (Na‘),S” (s)
LA

gain of 2e7

237

For convenience, each of the above
processes can be considered as two separate
steps, one involving the loss of electrons
and the other the gain of electrons. As an
illustration, we may further elaborate one of
these, say, the formation of sodium chloride.

2 Na(s) — 2 Na*(g) + 2e

Cl,(g) + 2e° > 2 CI(g)

Each of the above steps is called a half
reaction, which explicitly shows involvement
of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives
the overall reaction :

2 Na(s) + Cl, (g) — 2 Na* CI (s) or 2 NaCl (s)
Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half
reactions that involve loss of electrons are
called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the
half reactions that involve gain of electrons
are called reduction reactions. It may not
be out of context to mention here that the
new way of defining oxidation and reduction
has been achieved only by establishing a
correlation between the behaviour of species
as per the classical idea and their interplay
in electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12
to 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as
a reducing agent because it donates electron
to each of the elements interacting with it and
thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen
and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising
agents because these accept electrons from
sodium. To summarise, we may mention that

Oxidation : Loss of electron(s) by any species.
Reduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species.
Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s).
Reducing agent : Donor of electron(s).

Problem 7.2 Justify that the reaction:

2 Na(s) + H,(g) ~ 2 NaH (s) is a redox
change.

Solution

Since in the above reaction the compound
formed is an ionic compound, which may
also be represented as Na*H (s), this
suggests that one half reaction in this
process is :

2 Na (s) > 2 Na‘*(g) + 2e

Reprint 2025-26

10/10/2022 10:37:03 AM

Unit 7.indd 238

238

and the other half reaction is:

H, (g) + 2e > 2 H{g)

This splitting of the reaction under
examination into two half reactions
automatically reveals that here sodium
is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced,
therefore, the complete reaction is a
redox change.

7.2.1 Competitive Electron Transfer
Reactions

Place a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous
solution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig.
7.1, for about one hour. You may notice
that the strip becomes coated with reddish
metallic copper and the blue colour of the
solution disappears. Formation of Zn?* ions
among the products can easily be judged
when the blue colour of the solution due to
Cu** has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide
gas is passed through the colourless solution
containing Zn** ions, appearance of white zinc
sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the
solution alkaline with ammonia.

The reaction between metallic zinc and the
aqueous solution of copper nitrate is :

(7.15)

In reaction (7.15), zinc has lost electrons
to form Zn?* and, therefore, zinc is oxidised.
Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing
electrons, something must be reduced,
accepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper
ion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc.

Zn(s) + Cu?* (aq) > Zn?* (aq) + Cu(s)

Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as :

_ release of 2e Ww!

Zn(s) + Cu”(aq) ——> Zn”(aq) +Cu(s)

CHEMISTRY

At this stage we may investigate the state
of equilibrium for the reaction represented by
equation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place
a strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate
solution. No visible reaction is noticed and
attempt to detect the presence of Cu” ions
by passing H,S gas through the solution to
produce the black colour of cupric sulphide,
Cus, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has
such a low solubility that this is an extremely
sensitive test; yet the amount of Cu?* formed
cannot be detected. We thus conclude that
the state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15)
greatly favours the products over the reactants.

Let us extend electron transfer reaction
now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution
in water and arrange a set-up as shown in
Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour
due to the formation of Cu?* ions on account
of the reaction:

— release of 2e7

Cu(s) + 2Ag’(aq) ——> Cu”(aq) + 2Ag(s)

| gain of 2e |

(7.16)

Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu?*(aq) and
Ag*(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly
favours the products Cu” (aq) and Ag(s).

By way of contrast, let us also compare
the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel
sulphate solution. The reaction that occurs
here is :

— release of 2e"

Co(s) + Ni*(aq) ——> Co”(aq) + Ni(s)

At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both
Ni?*(aq) and Co?*(aq) are present at moderate
concentrations. In this case, neither the
reactants [Co(s) and Ni?*(aq)] nor the products
[Co?*(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured.

This competition for release of electrons
incidently reminds us of the competition for
release of protons among acids. The similarity
suggests that we might develop a table in
which metals and their ions are listed on the
basis of their tendency to release electrons
just as we do in the case of acids to indicate
the strength of the acids. As a matter of fact
we have already made certain comparisons.
By comparison we have come to know that
zinc releases electrons to copper and copper
releases electrons to silver and, therefore,
the electron releasing tendency of the metals
is in the order: Zn>Cu>Ag. We would love to
make our list more vast and design a metal
activity series or electrochemical series.
The competition for electrons between various
metals helps us to design a class of cells,
named as Galvanic cells in which the chemical
reactions become the source of electrical
energy. We would study more about these
cells in Class XII.

7.3 OXIDATION NUMBER

A less obvious example of electron transfer is
realised when hydrogen combines with oxygen
to form water by the reaction:
2H,(g) + O, (g) > 2H,0 (I) (7.18)
Though not simple in its approach, yet
we can visualise the H atom as going from a
neutral (zero) state in H, to a positive state in
H,O, the O atom goes from a zero state in O,
to a dinegative state in H,O. It is assumed that
there is an electron transfer from H to O and
consequently H, is oxidised and O, is reduced.

However, as we shall see later, the charge
transfer is only partial and is perhaps better
described as an electron shift rather than a
complete loss of electron by H and gain by
O. What has been said here with respect
to equation (7.18) may be true for a good
number of other reactions involving covalent
compounds. Two such examples of this class
of the reactions are:

H,(s) + Cl(g) — 2HCI(g) (7.19)
and,
CH,(g) + 4Cl1,(g) > CCL) +4HCl(g) (7.20)

In order to keep track of electron shifts
in chemical reactions involving formation
of covalent compounds, a more practical
method of using oxidation number has
been developed. In this method, it is always
assumed that there is a complete transfer
of electron from a less electronegative atom
to a more electonegative atom. For example,
we rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show
charge on each of the atoms forming part of
the reaction :

ie) fe) +1-2
2H,(g) + 0,(g) > 2H,0 (1) (7.21)
ie) ie) +1-1
H, (s) + CL(g) > 2HCIg) (7.22)
—-4+1 ie) +4-1 +1-1
CH,(g) + 4Cl,(g) > CCl, +4HCl{g) (7.23)

It may be emphasised that the assumption
of electron transfer is made for book-keeping
purpose only and it will become obvious at
a later stage in this unit that it leads to the
simple description of redox reactions.

Oxidation number denotes the oxidation
state of an element in a compound
ascertained according to a set of rules
formulated on the basis that electron pair

Reprint 2025-26

11/10/2022 15:18:03

Unit 7.indd 240

240

in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more
electronegative element.

It is not always possible to remember or
make out easily in a compound/ion, which
element is more electronegative than the
other. Therefore, a set of rules has been
formulated to determine the oxidation
number of an element in a compound/ion.
If two or more than two atoms of an element
are present in the molecule/ion such as
Na,S,O,/ Cr,O7, the oxidation number of the
atom of that element will then be the average
of the oxidation number of all the atoms of
that element. We may at this stage, state the
rules for the calculation of oxidation number.
These rules are:

1. Inelements, in the free or the uncombined
state, each atom bears an oxidation
number of zero. Evidently each atom in
H,, O,, Cl,, O,, P,, S,, Na, Mg, Al has the
oxidation number zero.

2. For ions composed of only one atom, the
oxidation number is equal to the charge
on the ion. Thus Na* ion has an oxidation
number of +1, Mg?* ion, +2, Fe** ion, +3,
Cl ion, -1, O% ion, —2; and so on. In their
compounds all alkali metals have oxidation
number of +1, and all alkaline earth metals
have an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium
is regarded to have an oxidation number of
+3 in all its compounds.

3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most
compounds is -2. However, we come
across two kinds of exceptions here.
One arises in the case of peroxides and
superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in
which oxygen atoms are directly linked to
each other. While in peroxides (e.g., H,O,,
Na,O,), each oxygen atom is assigned an
oxidation number of —1, in superoxides
(e.g., KO,, RbO,) each oxygen atom is
assigned an oxidation number of -(!4).
The second exception appears rarely, i.e.
when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In
such compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride
(OF,) and dioxygen difluoride (O,F,), the
oxygen is assigned an oxidation number
of +2 and +1, respectively. The number
assigned to oxygen will depend upon the

CHEMISTRY

bonding state of oxygen but this number

would now be a positive figure only.

4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1,
except when it is bonded to metals in binary
compounds (that is compounds containing
two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH,
and CaH,, its oxidation number is -1.

5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an
oxidation number of-1. Other halogens (Cl,
Br, and I) also have an oxidation number
of —-1, when they occur as halide ions in
their compounds. Chlorine, bromine and
iodine when combined with oxygen, for
example in oxoacids and oxoanions, have
positive oxidation numbers.

6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number
of all the atoms in a compound must be
zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum
of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of
the ion must equal the charge on the ion.
Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three
oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the
carbonate ion, (CO,)” must equal -2.

By the application of above rules, we can
find out the oxidation number of the desired
element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear
that the metallic elements have positive
oxidation number and nonmetallic elements
have positive or negative oxidation number.
The atoms of transition elements usually
display several positive oxidation states. The
highest oxidation number of a representative
element is the group number for the first
two groups and the group number minus 10
(following the long form of periodic table) for
the other groups. Thus, it implies that the
highest value of oxidation number exhibited
by an atom of an element generally increases
across the period in the periodic table. In the
third period, the highest value of oxidation
number changes from 1 to 7 as indicated
below in the compounds of the elements.

A term that is often used interchangeably
with the oxidation number is the oxidation
state. Thus in CO,, the oxidation state of
carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number
and similarly the oxidation state as well
as oxidation number of oxygen is - 2. This
implies that the oxidation number denotes the
oxidation state of an element in a compound.

The oxidation number/state of a metal ina
compound is sometimes presented according
to the notation given by German chemist,
Alfred Stock. It is popularly known as Stock
notation. According to this, the oxidation
number is expressed by putting a Roman
numeral representing the oxidation number
in parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in
the molecular formula. Thus aurous chloride
and auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and
Au(IICl,. Similarly, stannous chloride and
stannic chloride are written as Sn({II)Cl, and
Sn(IV)Cl,. This change in oxidation number
implies change in oxidation state, which in
turn helps to identify whether the species
is present in oxidised form or reduced form.
Thus, Hg, (DCL, is the reduced form of Hg{II) Cl,.

Problem 7.3

Using Stock notation, represent the
following compounds :HAuCL,, T1,O, FeO,
Fe,O,, Cul, CuO, MnO and MnoO,.

2~ 3’
Solution
By applying various rules of calculating
the oxidation number of the desired
element in a compound, the oxidation
number of each metallic element in its
compound is as follows:

HAuCl, > Au has 3
T1,O > Tl has 1
FeO > Fe has 2
Fe,O, > Fe has 3
Cul > Cu has 1
CuO > Cu has 2
MnO > Mn has 2
MnO > Mn has 4

2
Therefore, these compounds may be

represented as:
HAu(II)Cl,, T1,()O, Fe(I)O, Fe, (IMO,,
Cu(II, CuO, Mn(I)O, Mn(Ivjo,,

The idea of oxidation number has been
invariably applied to define oxidation,
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing
agent (reductant) and the redox reaction. To
summarise, we may say that:

Oxidation: An increase in the oxidation
number of the element in the given substance.

Reduction  : A decrease in the oxidation
number of the element in the given substance.

Oxidising agent: A reagent which can
increase the oxidation number of an element
in a given substance. These reagents are
called as oxidants also.

Reducing agent: A reagent which lowers the
oxidation number of an element in a given
substance. These reagents are also called as
reductants.

Redox reactions: Reactions which involve
change in oxidation number of the interacting
species.

Problem 7.4

Justify that the reaction:

2Cu,O(s) + Cu,S(s) > 6Cu(s) + SO,(g)
is a redox reaction. Identify the species

oxidised/reduced, which acts as an
oxidant and which acts as a reductant.

Solution

Let us assign oxidation number to each
of the species in the reaction under
examination. This results into:

+1 -2 +1 -2 fe) +4 -2
2Cu,O(s) + Cu,S(s) > 6Cu(s) + SO,

We therefore, conclude that in this
reaction copper is reduced from +1 state
to zero oxidation state and sulphur is
oxidised from —2 state to +4 state. The
above reaction is thus a redox reaction.

Reprint 2025-26

10/10/2022 10:37:04 AM

Unit 7.indd 242

242

Further, Cu,O helps sulphur in Cu,S to
increase its oxidation number, therefore,
Cu(I) is an oxidant; and sulphur of Cu,S
helps copper both in Cu,S itself and
Cu,O to decrease its oxidation number;
therefore, sulphur of Cu,S is reductant.

7.3.1 Types of Redox Reactions

1. Combination reactions

A combination reaction may be denoted in
the manner:
A+B->C

Either A and B or both A and B must be in
the elemental form for such a reaction to be
a redox reaction. All combustion reactions,
which make use of elemental dioxygen, as well
as other reactions involving elements other
than dioxygen, are redox reactions. Some
important examples of this category are:

ie) 0 +4 -2

C(s) + O,(g) 4> CO,(g) (7.24)
10) O +2 -3

3Mg(s) + N,(g) “> Mg.N,(s) (7.25)

-4+1 O +4 -2 +1-—2

CH,(g) + 20,(9-> CO{g + 2H,0 0)

2. Decomposition reactions

Decomposition reactions are the opposite
of combination reactions. Precisely, a
decomposition reaction leads to the breakdown
of a compound into two or more components
at least one of which must be in the elemental
state. Examples of this class of reactions are:

+1 -2 e) e)

2H,0 (I) “> 2H, (g) + Og) (7.26)
+1-1 ie) e)

2NaH (s) “> 2Na (s) + H,(g) (7.27)
+1 +5 -2 +1-1 fe)

2KCIO, (s) “> 2KCl(s) +309) (7.28)

It may carefully be noted that there is no
change in the oxidation number of hydrogen
in methane under combination reactions
and that of potassium in potassium chlorate
in reaction (7.28). This may also be noted

CHEMISTRY

here that all decomposition reactions are not
redox reactions. For example, decomposition
of calcium carbonate is not a redox reaction.

+2 +4 -2 +2 -2 +4 -2
Caco, (s) “> Cad(s) + CO,(g)
3. Displacement reactions

In a displacement reaction, an ion (or an
atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion
(or an atom) of another element. It may be
denoted as:

X +YZ > XZ +Y

Displacement reactions fit into two
categories: metal displacement and non-metal
displacement.

(a) Metal displacement: A metal in a
compound can be displaced by another metal
in the uncombined state. We have already
discussed about this class of the reactions
under section 7.2.1. Metal displacement
reactions find many applications in
metallurgical processes in which pure metals
are obtained from their compounds in ores. A
few such examples are:

+2 +6 -2 (@) (0) +2 +6 -2

CuSO, (aq) + Zn (s) + Cu(s) + ZnSO, (aq)
(7.29)

+5 -2 ) 0) +2 -2

V,O, (s) + 5Ca (s) “y av (s) + 5CaO (s)
(7.30)

+4-1 0) @) +2, -1

TiCl, () + 2Mg (s) “> Ti (s) + 2 MgCl, (s)
(7.31)

+3 -2 0 +3 -2 )

Cr,O, (s) + 2 Al (s) “4, Al,O, (s) + 2Cr(s)
(7.32)

In each case, the reducing metal is a
better reducing agent than the one that is
being reduced which evidently shows more
capability to lose electrons as compared to
the one that is reduced.

(b) Non-metal displacement: The non-
metal displacement redox reactions include
hydrogen displacement and a rarely occurring
reaction involving oxygen displacement.

All alkali metals and some alkaline earth
metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba) which are very good

(7.35)
0 +1-2 +3 -2 0

2Fe(s) + 3H,O() > Fe,0,(s) + 3H,(g) (7.36)

Many metals, including those which do not
react with cold water, are capable of displacing
hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids
may even be produced by such metals which
do not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are
the examples of such metals. A few examples
for the displacement of hydrogen from acids
are:

0 +1-1 +2 -1 0

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) — ZnCl, (aq) + H, (g)
(7.37)

(0) +1-1 +2 -1 ¢)

Mg (s) + 2HCI (aq) — MgCl, (aq) + H, (g)
(7.38)

0 +1-1 +2 -1 (0)

Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq) — FeCl,(aq) + H,(g)
(7.39)

Reactions (7.37 to 7.39) are used to
prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory.
Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in
the rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is
the slowest for the least active metal Fe, and
the fastest for the most reactive metal, Mg.
Very less active metals, which may occur in
the native state such as silver (Ag), and gold
(Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid.

In section (7.2.1) we have already discussed
that the metals — zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and
silver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons
show their reducing activity in the order Zn>

243

Cu>Ag. Like metals, activity series also exists
for the halogens. The power of these elements
as oxidising agents decreases as we move
down from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the
periodic table. This implies that fluorine is so
reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide
and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is
so reactive that it attacks water and displaces
the oxygen of water :

+1-2 ie) +1-1 ie)
2H,0 (I) + 2F, (g) > 4HF(aq) +0,(g) (7.40)
It is for this reason that the displacement
reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine
using fluorine are not generally carried out in
aqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine
can displace bromide and iodide ions in an
aqueous solution as shown below:

0 +1-1 +1-1 (0)

Cl, (g) + 2KBr (aq) — 2 KCl (aq) + Br, (I)
(7.41)

0 +1-1 +1-1 (0)

Cl, (g) + 2KI (aq) — 2 KCI (aq) + I, (s)
(7.42)

As Br, and I, are coloured and dissolve in CCL,,

can easily be identified from the colour of the

solution. The above reactions can be written

in ionic form as:

0) -1 -1 ()
Cl, (g) + 2Br (aq) — 2CI (aq) + Br, (I) (7.41a)
0) -1 -1 0)

Cl, (g) + 21 (aq) > 2CI (aq) +1, (s) (7.42b)
Reactions (7.41) and (7.42) form the basis
of identifying Br and I in the laboratory
through the test popularly known as ‘Layer
Test’. It may not be out of place to mention
here that bromine likewise can displace iodide
ion in solution:
0) -1 -1 )
Br, (I) + 2I- (aq) — 2Br (aq) + I, (s) (7.43)
The halogen displacement reactions have
a direct industrial application. The recovery
of halogens from their halides requires an
oxidation process, which is represented by:

2X > X, + 2e (7.44)
here X denotes a halogen element. Whereas

chemical means are available to oxidise CI,
Br and I, as fluorine is the strongest oxidising

agent; there is no way to convert F ions to F,
by chemical means. The only way to achieve
F, from F is to oxidise electrolytically, the
details of which you will study at a later stage.

4, Disproportionation reactions_

Disproportionation reactions are a special type
of redox reactions. In a disproportionation
reaction an element in one oxidation state
is simultaneously oxidised and reduced.
One of the reacting substances in a
disproportionation reaction always contains
an element that can exist in at least three
oxidation states. The element in the form
of reacting substance is in the intermediate
oxidation state; and both higher and lower
oxidation states of that element are formed in
the reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide is a familiar example of the reaction,
where oxygen experiences disproportionation.
+1-1 +1 -2 0
2H,O, (aq) — 2H,O()) + O,(g) (7.45)
Here the oxygen of peroxide, which is present
in -1 state, is converted to zero oxidation state
in O, and decreases to —2 oxidation state in
H,O.

Phosphorous, sulphur and chlorine
undergo disproportionation in the alkaline
medium as shown below :

(0) -3 +1
P,(s) + 30H (aq)+ 3H,O()) > PH.,(g) + 3H,PO;

(7.47)
(0) +1 -1
Cl, (g) + 2 OH (aq) > = ClO (aq) + CI (aq) +
1,0 0)
(7.48)

The reaction (7.48) describes the
formation of household bleaching agents.
The hypochlorite ion (ClO-) formed in the
reaction oxidises the colour-bearing stains
of the substances to colourless compounds.

It is of interest to mention here that whereas
bromine and iodine follow the same trend
as exhibited by chlorine in reaction (7.48),

CHEMISTRY

fluorine shows deviation from this behaviour
when it reacts with alkali. The reaction that
takes place in the case of fluorine is as follows:

2 F,(g) + 20H (aq) > 2 Faq) + OF ,(g) + H,O())
(7.49)

(It is to be noted with care that fluorine in
reaction (7.49) will undoubtedly attack water
to produce some oxygen also). This departure
shown by fluorine is not surprising for us as
we know the limitation of fluorine that, being
the most electronegative element, it cannot
exhibit any positive oxidation state. This
means that among halogens, fluorine does not
show a disproportionation tendency.

In reaction (a), the compound nitric displaced by hydride ion into dihydrogen

reaction.

The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number

Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular
element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:

C,O0, [where oxidation number of carbon is (4/3)],
Br,O, [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)]
and Na,S,O, (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).

We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons
are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average
oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the
element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.
Structure of the species C,0,, Br,O, and S,O; reveal the following bonding situations:

+2, 0 +2
O=C=C*=C=O0
Structure of C,0,

O (carbon suboxide) O O
OW 6 sil, ae” ~ Ts oo Mes
Oe: Br —Br=O a in ied
\
Oo” I No a a
Structure of Br,O, (tribromooctaoxide) Structure of S 05 (tetrathionate ion)

The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation
state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms of the same element in each of the species.
This reveals that in C,O,, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas
the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic
picture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br,O,, each
of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine
is present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is
16/3. In the same fashion, in the species SO, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation
state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four oxidation numbers of sulphurs
of the S,O,” is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for
each sulphur.

We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken
with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across
with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that
this is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in
that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe,O,, Mn,O,,
Pb,O, are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come
across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in

fraction as in O and O; where it is +% and —% respectively.

Problem 7.7

Why do the following reactions proceed
differently ?
Pb,O,, + 8HCl > 3PbCl, + Cl, + 4H,O and
Pb,O, + 4HNO, — 2Pb(NO,), + PbO, +
2H,O
Solution
Pb,O, is actually a stoichiometric
mixture of 2 mol of PbO and 1 mol of
PbO,. In PbO,, lead is present in +4
oxidation state, whereas the stable
oxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO,
thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising
agent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl ion
of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in
mind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore,
the reaction

Pb,O, + 8HCl > 3PbCl, + Cl, + 4H,O
can be splitted into two reactions namely:
2PbO + 4HCI — 2PbCl, + 2H,O

(acid-base reaction)
+4 -l +2 (0)
PbO, + 4HCl > PbCl, + Cl, +2H,O
(redox reaction)

Since HNO, itself is an oxidising agent
therefore, it is unlikely that the reaction
may occur between PbO, and HNO,,.
However, the acid-base reaction occurs
between PbO and HNO, as:

2PbO + 4HNO, — 2Pb(NO,), + 2H,O

It is the passive nature of PbO, against
HNO, that makes the reaction different
from the one that follows with HCl.

7.3.2 Balancing of Redox Reactions

Two methods are used to balance chemical
equations for redox processes. One of these
methods is based on the change in the
oxidation number of reducing agent and the
oxidising agent and the other method is based
on splitting the redox reaction into two half
reactions — one involving oxidation and the
other involving reduction. Both these methods
are in use and the choice of their use rests
with the individual using them.

CHEMISTRY

(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing
equations for oxidation-reduction reactions,
just as for other reactions, the compositions and
formulas must be known for the substances
that react and for the products that are
formed. The oxidation number method is now
best illustrated in the following steps:

Step 1: Write the correct formula for each
reactant and product.

Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo
change in oxidation number in the reaction
by assigning the oxidation number to all
elements in the reaction.

Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease
in the oxidation number per atom and for
the entire molecule/ion in which it occurs. If
these are not equal then multiply by suitable
number so that these become equal. (If you
realise that two substances are reduced and
nothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something
is wrong. Either the formulas of reactants or
products are wrong or the oxidation numbers
have not been assigned properly).

Step 4: Ascertain the involvement of ions if
the reaction is taking place in water, add H* or
OH ions to the expression on the appropriate
side so that the total ionic charges of reactants
and products are equal. If the reaction is
carried out in acidic solution, use H* ions in
the equation; if in basic solution, use OH ions.

Step 5: Make the numbers of hydrogen
atoms in the expression on the two sides
equal by adding water (H,O) molecules to the
reactants or products. Now, also check the
number of oxygen atoms. If there are the same
number of oxygen atoms in the reactants and
products, the equation then represents the
balanced redox reaction.

Let us now explain the steps involved in
the method with the help of a few problems
given below:

Problem 7.8

Write the net ionic equation for the
reaction of potassium dichromate(V]),
K,Cr,O, with sodium sulphite, Na,SO,,
in an acid solution to give chromium({(II])
ion and the sulphate ion.

Unit 7.indd 247

REDOX REACTIONS

Solution
Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is:
Cr,0? (aq) + SO,” (aq) — Cr**(aq)

+ SO? (aq)
Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for
CrandS
+6 -2 +4 -2 +3 +6 -2
Cr,O7 (aq) + SO} (aq) > Cr(aq)+SO,” (aq)
This indicates that the dichromate ion is

the oxidant and the sulphite ion is the
reductant.

Step 3: Calculate the increase and
decrease of oxidation number, and make
them equal: from step-2 we can notice
that there is change in oxidation state
of chromium and sulphur. Oxidation
state of chromium changes form +6 to
+3. There is decrease of +3 in oxidation
state of chromium on right hand side of
the equation. Oxidation state of sulphur
changes from +4 to +6. There is an increase
of +2 in the oxidation state of sulphur on
right hand side. To make the increase and
decrease of oxidation state equal, place
numeral 2 before cromium ion on right
hand side and numeral 3 before sulphate
ion on right hand side and balance the
chromium and sulphur atoms on both the
sides of the equation. Thus we get

+6 -2 +4 -2 +3
Cr,O,7 (aq) + 3SO3 (aq) — 2Cr** (aq) +
+6 -2
380? (aq)

Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the
acidic medium, and further the ionic
charges are not equal on both the sides,
add 8H‘ on the left to make ionic charges
equal
Cr,O? (aq) + 3SO0,”(aq)+ 8H*— 2Cr**(aq)
+ 3SO,” (aq)
Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen
atoms, and add appropriate number of
water molecules (i.e., 4H,O) on the right
to achieve balanced redox change.

Cr,O? (aq) + 3SO,” (aq)+ 8H* (aq) >
2Cr* (aq) + 3SO,” (aq) +4H,O (1)

Problem 7.9

Permanganate ion reacts with bromide
ion in basic medium to give manganese
dioxide and bromate ion. Write the
balanced ionic equation for the reaction.

Solution
Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is :
MnO, (aq) + Br (aq) — MnO,(s) + BrO; (aq)

Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for
Mn and Br

+7 =1 +4 +5
MnO,(aq) + Br (aq) ~Mn0O, (s) + BrO, (aq)
this indicates that permanganate ion
is the oxidant and bromide ion is the
reductant.

Step 3: Calculate the increase and
decrease of oxidation number, and make
the increase equal to the decrease.
+7 =l +4 +5

2MnO,(aq)+Br(aq) > 2Mn0O,(s)+BrO;(aq)
Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the
basic medium, and the ionic charges are
not equal on both sides, add 2 OH ions
on the right to make ionic charges equal.

2MnO; (aq) + Br (aq) — 2MnO,(s) +
BrO;(aq) + 2OH (aq)
Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms
and add appropriate number of water
molecules (i.e. one H,O molecule) on the
left side to achieve balanced redox change.
2MnO, (aq) + Br (aq) + H,O() — 2Mn0O,(s)
+ BrO, (aq) + 2OH (aq)

(b) Half Reaction Method: In this method,
the two half equations are balanced separately
and then added together to give balanced
equation.

Suppose we are to balance the equation
showing the oxidation of Fe”* ions to Fe** ions
by dichromate ions (Cr,O,)” in acidic medium,
wherein, Cr,O? ions are reduced to Cr* ions.
The following steps are involved in this task.

Step 1: Produce unbalanced equation for the

reaction in ionic form :

Fe**(aq) + Cr,O7 (aq) > Fe** (aq) + Cr**(aq)
(7.50)

Reprint 2025-26

10/10/2022 10:37:05 AM

Unit 7.indd 248

248

Step 2: Separate the equation into half-
reactions:

+2 +3,
Oxidation half : Fe** (aq) — Fe**(aq) = (7.51)
+6 -2 +3
Reduction half : Cr,O?(aq) > Cr**(aq)
(7.52)

Step 3: Balance the atoms other than O and
H in each half reaction individually. Here the
oxidation half reaction is already balanced
with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction
half reaction, we multiply the Cr** by 2 to
balance Cr atoms.
Cr,O? (aq) — 2 Cr**(aq) (7.53)
Step 4: For reactions occurring in acidic
medium, add H,O to balance O atoms and H*
to balance H atoms.
Thus, we get:
Cr,O? (aq) + 14H* (aq) > 2 Cr**(aq) + 7H,O (I)
(7.54)
Step 5: Add electrons to one side of the half
reaction to balance the charges. If need be,
make the number of electrons equal in the
two half reactions by multiplying one or both
half reactions by appropriate number.

The oxidation half reaction is thus
rewritten to balance the charge:
Fe?* (aq) > Fe* (aq) + ©& (7.55)

Now in the reduction half reaction there
are net twelve positive charges on the left hand
side and only six positive charges on the right
hand side. Therefore, we add six electrons on
the left side.

Cr,O? (aq) + 14H* (aq) + Ge > 2Cr**(aq) +
7H,O (I) (7.56)
To equalise the number of electrons in both
the half reactions, we multiply the oxidation
half reaction by 6 and write as :
6Fe”* (aq) > 6Fe**(aq) + 6e (7.57)
Step 6: We add the two half reactions to
achieve the overall reaction and cancel the
electrons on each side. This gives the net ionic
equation as :
6Fe**(aq) + Cr,O7(aq) + 14H*(aq) > 6 Fe**(aq) +
2Cr **(aq) + 7H,O() (7.58)

CHEMISTRY

Step 7: Verify that the equation contains the
same type and number of atoms and the same
charges on both sides of the equation. This
last check reveals that the equation is fully
balanced with respect to number of atoms
and the charges.

For the reaction in a basic medium, first
balance the atoms as is done in acidic medium.
Then for each H* ion, add an equal number of
OH ions to both sides of the equation. Where
H* and OH- appear on the same side of the
equation, combine these to give H,O.

REDOX REACTIONS

the resultant equation is:
MnO; (aq) + 2H,O (1) > Mno, (s) + 4 OH (aq)
Step 5: In this step we balance the

charges of the two half-reactions in the
manner depicted as:

2I (aq) > I, (s) + 2e
MnO,{(aq) + 2H,O()) + 3e > MnO,(s)
+ 40H (aq)

Now to equalise the number of electrons,
we multiply the oxidation half-reaction by
3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2.

6I(aq) — 31, (s) + Ge

2 MnO; (aq) + 4H,O (1) +6e€ — 2MnO,(s)
+ 80H: (aq)

Step 6: Add two half-reactions to
obtain the net reactions after cancelling
electrons on both sides.

6I-(aq) + 2MnO-(aq) + 4H,O(l) > 3I1,(s) +
2Mn0O,(s) +8 OH (aq)

Step 7: A final verification shows that
the equation is balanced in respect of
the number of atoms and charges on
both sides.

7.3.3 Redox Reactions as the Basis _ for
Titrations

In acid-base systems we come across with a
titration method for finding out the strength
of one solution against the other using a
pH sensitive indicator. Similarly, in redox
systems, the titration method can be adopted
to determine the strength of a reductant/
oxidant using a redox sensitive indicator.
The usage of indicators in redox titration is
illustrated below:

(i) In one situation, the reagent itself is
intensely coloured, e.g., permanganate
ion, MnO;. Here MnO; acts as the self
indicator. The visible end point in this case
is achieved after the last of the reductant
(Fe** or C,O,”) is oxidised and the first
lasting tinge of pink colour appears at
MnO, concentration as low as 10° mol dm®
(10° mol L). This ensures a minimal
‘overshoot in colour beyond the equivalence
point, the point where the reductant and
the oxidant are equal in terms of their
mole stoichiometry.

249

(ii) If there is no dramatic auto-colour change
(as with MnO; titration), there are indicators
which are oxidised immediately after the
last bit of the reactant is consumed,
producing a dramatic colour change. The
best example is afforded by Cr,O7, which
is not a self-indicator, but oxidises the
indicator substance diphenylamine just
after the equivalence point to produce an
intense blue colour, thus signalling the
end point.

(iii) There is yet another method which is
interesting and quite common. Its use is
restricted to those reagents which are able
to oxidise I ions, say, for example, Cu(ID:
2Cu”*(aq) + 41 (aq) > Cu,1,(s) + L,(aq) (7.59)
This method relies on the facts that

iodine itself gives an intense blue colour with

starch and has a very specific reaction with
thiosulphate ions (S,O,”), which too is a redox
reaction:

L(aq) + 2 S,OF (aq) 2I (aq) + S,0,” (aq) (7.60)

I,, though insoluble in water, remains in
solution containing KI as KI,.

On addition of starch after the liberation
of iodine from the reaction of Cu?* ions on
iodide ions, an intense blue colour appears.
This colour disappears as soon as the iodine
is consumed by the thiosulphate ions. Thus,
the end-point can easily be tracked and the
rest is the stoichiometric calculation only.

7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation
Number

As you have observed in the above discussion,
the concept of redox processes has been
evolving with time. This process of evolution
is continuing. In fact, in recent past the
oxidation process is visualised as a decrease
in electron density and reduction process as
an increase in electron density around the
atom(s) involved in the reaction.

7.4 REDOX REACTIONS AND ELECTRODE
PROCESSES

The experiment corresponding to reaction
(7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is
dipped in copper sulphate solution. The
redox reaction takes place and during the

Reprint 2025-26

10/10/2022 10:37:05 AM

Unit 7.indd 250

250

reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and
copper ions are reduced to metallic copper
due to direct transfer of electrons from zinc
to copper ion. During this reaction heat is
also evolved. Now we modify the experiment
in such a manner that for the same redox
reaction transfer of electrons takes place
indirectly. This necessitates the separation
of zinc metal from copper sulphate solution.
We take copper sulphate solution in a beaker
and put a copper strip or rod in it. We also
take zinc sulphate solution in another beaker
and put a zinc rod or strip init. Now reaction
takes place in either of the beakers and at the
interface of the metal and its salt solution in
each beaker both the reduced and oxidized
forms of the same species are present. These
represent the species in the reduction and
oxidation half reactions. A redox couple is
defined as having together the oxidised and
reduced forms of a substance taking part in
an oxidation or reduction half reaction.

This is represented by separating the
oxidised form from the reduced form by
a vertical line or a slash representing an
interface (e.g. solid/solution). For example

are represented as Zn?*/Zn and Cu?*/Cu.
In both cases, oxidised form is put before
the reduced form. Now we put the beaker
containing copper sulphate solution and the
beaker containing zinc sulphate solution
side by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions
in two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube
containing a solution of potassium chloride
or ammonium nitrate usually solidified by
boiling with agar agar and later cooling to a
jelly like substance). This provides an electric
contact between the two solutions without
allowing them to mix with each other. The
zinc and copper rods are connected by a
metallic wire with a provision for an ammeter
and a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3
is known as Daniell cell. When the switch is
in the off position, no reaction takes place in
either of the beakers and no current flows
through the metallic wire. As soon as the
switch is in the on position, we make the
following observations:

1. The transfer of electrons now does not
take place directly from Zn to Cu? but
through the metallic wire connecting the
two rods as is apparent from the arrow
which indicates the flow of current.

2. The electricity from solution in one beaker
to solution in the other beaker flows by
the migration of ions through the salt
bridge. We know that the flow of current
is possible only if there is a potential
difference between the copper and zinc
rods known as electrodes here.

The potential associated with each
electrode is known as electrode potential.
If the concentration of each species taking
part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any
gas appears in the electrode reaction, it is
confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and
further the reaction is carried out at 298K,
then the potential of each electrode is said
to be the Standard Electrode Potential. By
convention, the standard electrode potential
(E°) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The
electrode potential value for each electrode
process is a measure of the relative tendency
of the active species in the process to remain
in the oxidised/reduced form. A negative E®*
means that the redox couple is a stronger

CHEMISTRY

SUMMARY

Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction
occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation
number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation,
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed
according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a
consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in
writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories:
combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of
redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide
applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

EXERCISES
7.1 Assign oxidation number to the underlined elements in each of the following species:
(a) NaH,PO, (b)NaHSO,  (c) H,P,0, (d) K,MnoO,
(e) CaO, () NaBH, (g) H,S,0, (h) KAI(SO,),.12 H,O
7.2 What are the oxidation number of the underlined elements in each of the following

and how do you rationalise your results ?

(a) Kl,  (b) H,S,0, (©) Fe,O, (a) CH,CH,OH ~—(e) CH,COOH
7.3 Justify that the following reactions are redox reactions:

(a) CuO(s) + H,(g) — Cu(s) + H,Of(g)

(b) Fe,0,(s) + 3CO(g) > 2Fe(s) + 3CO,(g)

(c) 4BCl,(g) + 3LiAlH,(s) — 2B,H,(g) + 3LiCl(s) + 3 AICI, (s)

(d) 2K(s) + F,(g) ~ 2K’F (s)

(ec) 4 NH,{(g) + 5 O,(g) ~ 4NO(g) + 6H,Ofg)
7.4 Fluorine reacts with ice and results in the change:

H,O(s) + F,(g) — HF(g) + HOF{(g)

Justify that this reaction is a redox reaction.

7.5 Calculate the oxidation number of sulphur, chromium and nitrogen in H,SO,, Cr,O?
and NO;. Suggest structure of these compounds. Count for the fallacy.

7.6 Write formulas for the following compounds:
(a) Mercury(ID chloride (b) Nickel(II) sulphate
(c) Tin(IV) oxide (d) Thallium(I) sulphate
(e) Iron(II) sulphate (f) Chromium(III oxide

7.7 Suggest a list of the substances where carbon can exhibit oxidation states from —4
to +4 and nitrogen from -3 to +5.

7.8 While sulphur dioxide and hydrogen peroxide can act as oxidising as well as reducing
agents in their reactions, ozone and nitric acid act only as oxidants. Why ?

7.9 Consider the reactions:
(a) 6 CO,(g) + 6H,O0) > C,H,, O,(aq) + 60,(g)

(b) O,(g) + H,0,0) > H,O() + 20,(g)

Why it is more appropriate to write these reactions as :

(a) 6CO,(g) + 12H,O(l) — C,H,, O,(aq) + 6H,O() + 60,(g)
(b) O,(g) + H,O,0) > H,O() + O,(g) + O,(g)

Also suggest a technique to investigate the path of the above (a) and (b) redox
reactions.

The compound AgF, is unstable compound. However, if formed, the compound acts
as a very strong oxidising agent. Why ?

Whenever a reaction between an oxidising agent and a reducing agent is carried out,
a compound of lower oxidation state is formed if the reducing agent is in excess and
a compound of higher oxidation state is formed if the oxidising agent is in excess.
Justify this statement giving three illustrations.

How do you count for the following observations ?

(a) Though alkaline potassium permanganate and acidic potassium permanganate
both are used as oxidants, yet in the manufacture of benzoic acid from toluene
we use alcoholic potassium permanganate as an oxidant. Why ? Write a balanced
redox equation for the reaction.

(b) When concentrated sulphuric acid is added to an inorganic mixture containing
chloride, we get colourless pungent smelling gas HCl, but if the mixture contains
bromide then we get red vapour of bromine. Why ?

Identify the substance oxidised reduced, oxidising agent and reducing agent for
each of the following reactions:

(a) 2AgBr (s) + C,H,O,(aq) 2Ag(s) + 2HBr (aq) + C,H,O,(aq)
(b) HCHO() + 2[Ag (NH,),]*(aq) + 30H (aq) 2Ag(s) + HCOO (aq) + 4NH,(aq)
+ 2H2O0(I)
(c) HCHO ()) + 2 Cu*(aq) + 5 OH(aq) Cu2O(s) + HCOO (aq) + 3H,O())
(d) N,H,@) + 2H,0,() > N,(g) + 4H,0()
(e) Pb(s) + PbO,(s) + 2H,SO,(aq) - 2PbSO,(s) + 2H,O()
Consider the reactions :
2 S,OF (aq) + L(s) > S, OF (aq) + 2T (aq)
S,O7 (aq) + 2Br,() + 5 H,O() > 2SO07 (aq) + 4Br (aq) + 10H*(aq)

Why does the same reductant, thiosulphate react differently with iodine and
bromine ?

Justify giving reactions that among halogens, fluorine is the best oxidant and among
hydrohalic compounds, hydroiodic acid is the best reductant.

Why does the following reaction occur ?
XeO,* (aq) + 2F (aq) + 6H*(aq) > XeO,(g)+ F,(g) + 3H,O()

What conclusion about the compound Na,XeO, (of which XeO¢ is a part) can be
drawn from the reaction.

Consider the reactions:
(a) H,PO,(aq) + 4 AgNO,(aq) + 2 H,O() ~ H,PO,(aq) + 4Ag(s) + 4HNO,(aq)
(b) H,PO,(aq) + 2CuSO (aq) +2 H,O() — H,PO ,(aq) + 2Cu(s) + H,SO (aq)
(c) C,H,CHO() + 2[Ag (NH,),}*(aq) + 30H (aq) > C,H,COO (aq) + 2Ag(s) +
4NH, (aq) + 2 H,O())
(d) C,H,CHO() + 2Cu?*(aq) + 50H (aq) > No change observed.
