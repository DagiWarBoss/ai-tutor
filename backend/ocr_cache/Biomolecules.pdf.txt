addition, some simple molecules like vitamins and
mineral salts also play an important role in the functions
of organisms. Structures and functions of some of these
biomolecules are discussed in this Unit.

10.1 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large
group of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common
examples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of
them have a general formula, C,(H,O),, and were considered as hydrates
of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example,
the molecular formula of glucose (C,H,,O,) fits into this general formula,
C,(H,O),. But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be
classified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH;COOH) fits into
this general formula, C,(H,O), but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly,
rhamnose, C,H,.O; is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition.
A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific
functional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as
optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds
which produce such units on hydrolysis. Some of the carbohydrates,
which are sweet in taste, are also called sugars. The most common
sugar, used in our homes is named as sucrose whereas the sugar present

in milk is known as lactose. Carbohydrates are also called saccharides
(Greek: sakcharon means sugar).

Carbohydrates are classified on the basis of their behaviour on
hydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups.
(i) Monosaccharides: A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further

to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a
monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in
nature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc.
Oligosaccharides: Carbohydrates that yield two to ten
monosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They
are further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides,
etc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide
on hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides.
The two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide
may be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on
hydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose
whereas maltose gives two molecules of only glucose.
Polysaccharides: Carbohydrates which yield a large number of
monosaccharide units on hydrolysis are called polysaccharides.
Some common examples are starch, cellulose, glycogen, gums,
etc. Polysaccharides are not sweet in taste, hence they are also
called non-sugars.

The carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non-
reducing sugars. All those carbohydrates which reduce Fehling’s
solution and Tollens’ reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All
monosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars.

Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon
atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide
contains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains
a keto group, it is known as a ketose. Number of carbon atoms
constituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is
evident from the examples given in Table 10.1

Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form. It is
present in sweet fruits and honey. Ripe grapes also contain glucose
in large amounts. It is prepared as follows:

From sucrose (Cane sugar): If sucrose is boiled with dilute HCl or
H,SO, in alcoholic solution, glucose and fructose are obtained in
equal amounts.

Starch or cellulose Glucose

Glucose is an aldohexose and is also known as dextrose. It is the
monomer of many of the larger carbohydrates, namely starch, cellulose.
It is probably the most abundant organic compound on earth. It was
assigned the structure given below on the basis of the following
evidences:

1. Its molecular formula was found to be CgH,.0..

2. On prolonged heating with HI, it forms n-hexane, suggesting that all
the six carbon atoms are linked in a straight chain.

3. Glucose reacts with hydroxylamine to form an oxime and adds a
molecule of hydrogen cyanide to give cyanohydrin. These reactions
confirm the presence of a carbonyl group (>C = O) in glucose.

indicates that the carbonyl group is present as an aldehydic group.

it exists as a stable compound, five -OH groups should be attached
to different carbon atoms.

Glucose is correctly named as D(+)-glucose. ‘D’ before the name
of glucose represents the configuration whereas ‘(+)’ represents
dextrorotatory nature of the molecule. It should be remembered that
‘D’ and ‘LV’ have no relation with the optical activity of the compound.
They are also not related to letter ‘d’ and ‘T (see Unit 6). The meaning
of D- and L~ notations is as follows.

The letters ‘D’ or ‘L’ before the name of any compound indicate the
relative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with
respect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of
which is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their
relation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde
contains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric
forms as shown below.

(+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has ‘D’ configuration. It means that when
its structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions
which you will study in higher classes, the -OH group lies on right hand
side in the structure. All those compounds which can be chemically
correlated to D (+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have D-
configuration whereas those which can be correlated to ‘L’ (-) isomer of
glyceraldehyde are said to have L—configuration. In L (-) isomer -OH

the configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon
atom (as shown below) which is compared. As in (+) glucose, —OH on
the lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable
to (+) glyceraldehyde, so (+) glucose is assigned D-configuration. Other
asymmetric carbon atoms of glucose are not considered for this
comparison. Also, the structure of glucose and glyceraldehyde is written
in a way that most oxidised carbon (in this case -CHO)is at the top.

of Glucose’ 1. Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff
test and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with
NaHSOs3.

2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine
indicating the absence of free —CHO group.

3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are
named as o and B. The a-form of glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by
crystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while
the B-form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and
saturated aqueous solution at 371 K.

This behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure
(I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the —OH groups may add
to the —CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was
found that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which —OH at C-5
is involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of —CHO
group and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below.
These two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure.

10.1.3 You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute
Disaccharides acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different
monosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an
oxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage
between two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called
glycosidic linkage.

In disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i.e.,
aldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars,
e.g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups

are free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose.
(J) Sucrose: One of the common disaccharides is sucrose which on
hydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose.

Sucrose D-(+)-Glucose D-(-)-Fructose

These two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic
linkage between C1 of a-D-glucose and C2 of B-D-fructose. Since
the reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in
glycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar.

Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives
dextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since the
laevorotation of fructose (-92.4°) is more than dextrorotation of
glucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of
sucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro
(+) to laevo (-) and the product is named as invert sugar.

(i) Maltose: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two
a-D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4
of another glucose unit (IJ). The free aldehyde group can be
produced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing
properties so it is a reducing sugar.

Polysaccharides contain a large number of monosaccharide units joined
together by glycosidic linkages. These are the most commonly
encountered carbohydrates in nature. They mainly act as the food
storage or structural materials.

() Starch: Starch is the main storage polysaccharide of plants. It is
the most important dietary source for human beings. High content
of starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It
is a polymer of a-glucose and consists of two components—
Amylose and Amylopectin. Amylose is water soluble component
which constitutes about 15-20% of starch. Chemically amylose is
a long unbranched chain with 200-1000 a-D-(+)-glucose units
held together by Cl- C4 glycosidic linkage.

Amylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 80-
85% of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of a-D-glucose
units in which chain is formed by C1-C4 glycosidic linkage whereas
branching occurs by C1-C6 glycosidic linkage.

It is also known as animal starch because its structure is similar to
amylopectin and is rather more highly branched. It is present in liver,
muscles and brain. When the body needs glucose, enzymes break the
glycogen down to glucose. Glycogen is also found in yeast and fungi.

Proteins are the most abundant biomolecules of the living system.
Chief sources of proteins are milk, cheese, pulses, peanuts, fish, meat,
etc. They occur in every part of the body and form the fundamental
basis of structure and functions of life. They are also required for
growth and maintenance of body. The word protein is derived from
Greek word, “proteios” which means primary or of prime importance.
All proteins are polymers of a-amino acids.

Amino acids contain amino (-NH,) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional
groups. Depending upon the relative position of amino group with
respect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be R—CH—COOH
classified as a, 8B, y, 6 and so on. Only o-amino |

acids are obtained on hydrolysis of proteins. They NH,

All a-amino acids have trivial names, which (R= side chain)

usually reflect the property of that compound or

its source. Glycine is so named since it has sweet taste (in Greek glykos
means sweet) and tyrosine was first obtained from cheese (in Greek, tyros
means cheese.) Amino acids are generally represented by a three letter

Amino acids are classified as acidic, basic or neutral depending upon
the relative number of amino and carboxyl groups in their molecule.
Equal number of amino and carboxyl groups makes it neutral; more
number of amino than carboxyl groups makes it basic and more
carboxyl groups as compared to amino groups makes it acidic. The
amino acids, which can be synthesised in the body, are known as non-
essential amino acids. On the other hand, those which cannot be
synthesised in the body and must be obtained through diet, are known
as essential amino acids (marked with asterisk in Table 10.2).

Amino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are
water-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than
simple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence

of both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino
O group) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous

and amino group can accept a proton, giving rise

"NH, to a dipolar ion known as Zwitter ion. This is
(Zwitter ion) neutral but contains both positive and negative
charges.

In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as
they react both with acids and bases.

Except glycine, all other naturally occurring o-amino acids are
optically active, since the a-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist
both in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have
L-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the -NH, group
on left hand side.

You have already read that proteins are the polymers of a-amino acids
and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide
linkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between
—COOH group and -NH, group. The reaction between two molecules of
similar or different amino acids, proceeds through
the combination of the amino group of one molecule
CH, with the carboxyl group of the other. This results in

the elimination of a water molecule and formation of

is called a dipeptide because it is made up of two
CH, amino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of
glycine combines with the amino group of alanine

Glycylalanine (Gly-Ala) we get a dipeptide, glycylalanine.

Chemistry 025

If a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a
tripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide
linkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective
products are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide,
respectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then
the products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred
amino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called
a protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is
not very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called
proteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such
as insulin which contains 51 amino acids.

Proteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their
molecular shape.

(a) Fibrous proteins

When the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by
hydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre- like structure is formed. Such
proteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are
keratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.

Reprint 2025-26

(b) Globular proteins

This structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around
to give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin
and albumins are the common examples of globular proteins.

Structure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different
levels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level
being more complex than the previous one.

(@) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have
one or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a
protein has amino acids linked with each other in a
specific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids
that is said to be the primary structure of that protein.
Any change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence
of amino acids creates a different protein.

(i) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary
structure of protein refers to the shape in which a long
polypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in
two different types of structures viz. a-helix and
B-pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due
to the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide

O

chain due to hydrogen bonding between d and

-NH- groups of the peptide bond.
a-Helix is one of the most common ways in which
a polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds
by twisting into a right handed screw (helix) with the
Fig. 10.1: a-Helix NH group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the
structure of proteins C=O of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.10.1.

destroyed but primary structure remains intact. The coagulation of
egg white on boiling is a common example of denaturation. Another
example is curdling of milk which is caused due to the formation of
lactic acid by the bacteria present in milk.

higher than that of the corresponding halo acids. Explain.

10.5 Where does the water present in the egg go after boiling the egg?

10.3 Enzymes Life is possible due to the coordination of various chemical reactions in
living organisms. An example is the digestion of food, absorption of
appropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process
involves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the
body under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain
biocatalysts called enzymes. Almost all the enzymes are globular
proteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a
particular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or
class of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme
that catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as maltase.

Maltose Glucose

Sometimes enzymes are also named after the reaction, where they
are used. For example, the enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of
one substrate with simultaneous reduction of another substrate are
named as oxidoreductase enzymes. The ending of the name of an
enzyme is -ase.

10.3.1 Mechanism = Fyzymes are needed only in small quantities for the progress of a reaction.
of Enzyme similar to the action of chemical catalysts, enzymes are said to reduce
Action the magnitude of activation energy. For example, activation energy for

acid hydrolysis of sucrose is 6.22 kJ mol, while the activation energy is
only 2.15 kJ mol when hydrolysed by the enzyme, sucrase. Mechanism
for the enzyme action has been discussed.

10.4 Vitamins It has been observed that certain organic compounds are required in
small amounts in our diet but their deficiency causes specific diseases.
These compounds are called vitamins. Most of the vitamins cannot be
synthesised in our body but plants can synthesise almost all of them,
so they are considered as essential food factors. However, the bacteria
of the gut can produce some of the vitamins required by us. All the
vitamins are generally available in our diet. Different vitamins belong
to various chemical classes and it is difficult to define them on the
basis of structure. They are generally regarded as organic compounds
required in the diet in small amounts to perform specific
biological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth

and health of the organism. Vitamins are designated by alphabets
A, B, C, D, etc. Some of them are further named as sub-groups e.g. By,
B,, Bs, By, etc. Excess of vitamins is also harmful and vitamin pills
should not be taken without the advice of doctor.

The term “Vitamine” was coined from the word vital + amine since
the earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed
that most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter ‘e’ was
dropped and the term vitamin is used these days.

Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility
in water or fat.
(i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils
but insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A,
D, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing) tissues.
(ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble
in water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must
be supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in
urine and cannot be stored (except vitamin B,,) in our body.
Some important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by
their deficiency are listed in Table 10.3.

10.5 Vlucleic Acids Every generation of each and every species resembles its ancestors in
many ways. How are these characteristics transmitted from one
generation to the next? It has been observed that nucleus of a living
cell is responsible for this transmission of inherent characters, also
called heredity. The particles in nucleus of the cell, responsible for
heredity, are called chromosomes which are made up of proteins and
another type of biomolecules called nucleic acids. These are mainly
of two types, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
(RNA). Since nucleic acids are long chain polymers of nucleotides, so
they are also called polynucleotides.

James Dewey Watson

Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Dr Watson received his Ph.D.
(1950) from Indiana University in Zoology. He is best known for
his discovery of the structure of DNA for which he shared with
Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel prize in
Physiology and Medicine. They proposed that DNA molecule takes
the shape of a double helix, an elegantly simple structure that
resembles a gently twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are
made of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose;
the rungs are each composed of a pair of purine/ pyrimidine bases. This
research laid the foundation for the emerging field of molecular biology. The
complementary pairing of nucleotide bases explains how identical copies of
parental DNA pass on to two daughter cells. This research launched a revolution
in biology that led to modern recombinant DNA techniques.

A unit formed by the attachment of a base to 1’ position of sugar is
known as nucleoside. In nucleosides, the sugar carbons are numbered
as 1’, 2’, 3’, etc. in order to distinguish these from the bases
(Fig. 10.5a). When nucleoside is linked to phosphoric acid at 5’-position
of sugar moiety, we get a nucleotide (Fig. 10.5).

Information regarding the sequence of nucleotides in the chain
of a nucleic acid is called its primary structure. Nucleic acids
have a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick
gave a double strand helix structure for DNA (Fig. 10.7). Two
nucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together
by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. The two strands are
complementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are
formed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen
bonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds
with guanine.

In secondary structure of RNA single stranded helics is present
which sometimes foldsback on itself. RNA molecules are of three
types and they perform different functions. They are named as
messenger RNA (m-RNA), ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) and transfer
RNA (t-RNA).

Har Gobind Khorana

Har Gobind Khorana, was born in 1922. He obtained his M.Sc.
degree from Punjab University in Lahore. He worked with Professor
Vladimir Prelog, who moulded Khorana’s thought and philosophy
towards science, work and effort. After a brief stay in India in
1949, Khorana went back to England and worked with Professor
G.W. Kenner and Professor A.R.Todd. It was at Cambridge, U.K.
that he got interested in both proteins and nucleic acids. Dr Khorana shared the
Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with Marshall Nirenberg and Robert
Holley for cracking the genetic code.

DNA Fingerprinting

It is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of

the fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be

altered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and

information regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and

cannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used

(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals.

(ii) to determine paternity of an individual.

(iii) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA’s of parents or
children.

(iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution.

Functions of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining
of Nucleic _ the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A
Acids DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and
identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important
function of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the
proteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the
message for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA.

10.0 Hormones Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These
are produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly
in the blood stream which transports them to the site of action.

In terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e.g., estrogens
and androgens; some are poly peptides for example insulin and
endorphins and some others are amino acid derivatives such as
epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Hormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain
the balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping
the blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this
function. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose
level. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose
level in the blood. The two hormones together regulate the glucose level
in the blood. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate responses to
external stimuli. Growth hormones and sex hormones play role in growth
and development. Thyroxine produced in the thyroid gland is an iodinated
derivative of amino acid tyrosine. Abnormally low level of thyroxine leads

Chemistry 8005

Reprint 2025-26


to hypothyroidism which is characterised by lethargyness and obesity.
Increased level of thyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Low level of iodine
in the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid
gland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide
to commercial table salt (“Iodised” salt).

Steroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads (testes
in males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex
play very important role in the functions of the body. For example,
glucocorticoids control the carbohydrate metabolism, modulate
inflammatory reactions, and are involved in reactions to stress. The
mineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the
kidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results
may be Addison’s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and
increased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by
glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are
responsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is
the major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development
of secondary male characteristics (deep voice, facial hair, general physical
constitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible
for development of secondary female characteristics and participates in
the control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing
the uterus for implantation of fertilised egg.

10.6 Why cannot vitamin C be stored in our body?

10.7 What products would be formed when a nucleotide from DNA containing
thymine is hydrolysed?

10.8 When RNAis hydrolysed, there is no relationship among the quantities of different
bases obtained. What does this fact suggest about the structure of RNA?

Summa ry

Carbohydrates are optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or molecules which
provide such units on hydrolysis. They are broadly classified into three groups —
monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Glucose, the most important
source of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides
are held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.

Proteins are the polymers of about twenty different a-amino acids which are
linked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because
they cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins
perform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which
contain only a-amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary
structure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH or temperature and they are not
able to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are
biocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and
selective in their action and chemically majority of enzymes are proteins.

Vitamins are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as
fat soluble (A, D, E and K) and water soluble (B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins
leads to many diseases.

Nucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base,
a pentose sugar and phosphate moiety. Nucleic acids are responsible for the transfer
of characters from parents to offsprings. There are two types of nucleic acids —
DNA and RNA. DNA contains a five carbon sugar molecule called 2-deoxyribose
whereas RNA contains ribose. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine, guanine and
cytosine. The fourth base is thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. The structure of
DNA is a double strand whereas RNA is a single strand molecule. DNA is the
chemical basis of heredity and have the coded message for proteins to be synthesised
in the cell. There are three types of RNA — mRNA, rRNA and tRNA which actually
carry out the protein synthesis in the cell.
