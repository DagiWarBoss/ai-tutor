6.1 Introduction

Suppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number
lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9.
The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a
particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have
forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only
the first digit which is 7. In order to open the lock, how
many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To
answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all
possible arrangements of 9 remaining digits taken 3 at a

time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number

. . . Jacob Bernoulli
of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, (1654-1705)

we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will

enable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact,
these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging
and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a
principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques.

6.2 Fundamental Principle of Counting

Let us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many
different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which
a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be
chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore,
there are 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt.

Let us name the three pants as P,, P,, P; and the two shirts as S,, S,. Then,
these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1.

Let us consider another problem 6 Possibilities

of the same type. P,S,
Sabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes
and 2 water bottles. In how many ways
can she carry these items (choosing one
each).

A school bag can be chosen in 2
different ways. After a school bag is
chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3
different ways. Hence, there are
2 x 3=6 pairs of school bag and a tiffin
box. For each of these pairs a water
bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. Fig 6.1
Hence, there are 6 x 2 = 12 different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to
school. If we name the 2 school bags as B,, B,, the three tiffin boxes as T,, T,, T, and
the two water bottles as W,, W,, these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2.

102 MATHEMATICS

In fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following
principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication
principle, which states that

“Tf an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event
can occur in n different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events
in the given order is mxXn.”

The above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For
example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows:

‘If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can
occur inn different ways, following which a third event can occur in p different ways,
then the total number of occurrence to ‘the events in the given order is m x n X p.”

In the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt
was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:

(i) the event of choosing a pant

(ii) the event of choosing a shirt.

In the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different
ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:

(i) the event of choosing a school bag

(ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box

(iii) the event of choosing a water bottle.

Here, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible
orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of
different ways of the occurence of the events in this chosen order.

Example 1 Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be
formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not
allowed.

Solution There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places

by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The

first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following
which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3
different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following
which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the
4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 =24. Hence, the
required number of words is 24.

Reprint 2025-26

PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 103

If the repetition of the letters was allowed, how many words can be formed?

One can easily understand that each of the 4 vacant places can be filled in succession
in 4 different ways. Hence, the required number of words = 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 = 256.

Example 2 Given 4 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be
generated, if a signal requires the use of 2 flags one below the other?

Solution There will be as many signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places

in succession by the 4 flags of different colours. The upper vacant place can

be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 flags; following which, the lower vacant
place can be filled in 3 different ways by anyone of the remaining 3 different flags.
Hence, by the multiplication principle, the required number of signals = 4 x 3 = 12.

Example 3 How many 2 digit even numbers can be formed from the digits
1, 2,3, 4, 5 if the digits can be repeated?

Solution There will be as many ways as there are ways of filling 2 vacant places

in succession by the five given digits. Here, in this case, we start filling in unit’s

place, because the options for this place are 2 and 4 only and this can be done in 2
ways; following which the ten’s place can be filled by any of the 5 digits in 5 different
ways as the digits can be repeated. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the required
number of two digits even numbers is 2 x 5, i.e., 10.

Example 4 Find the number of different signals that can be generated by arranging at
least 2 flags in order (one below the other) on a vertical staff, if five different flags are
available.

Solution A signal can consist of either 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags or 5 flags. Now, let us
count the possible number of signals consisting of 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags and 5 flags
separately and then add the respective numbers.

There will be as many 2 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places

in succession by the 5 flags available. By Multiplication rule, the number of

ways is 5 x 4= 20.
Similarly, there will be as many 3 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 3

vacant places in succession by the 5 flags.

Reprint 2025-26

104 MATHEMATICS

The number of ways is 5 x 4 x 3 =60.
Continuing the same way, we find that
The number of 4 flag signals = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2= 120
and the number of 5 flag signals = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
Therefore, the required no of signals = 20 + 60 + 120 + 120 = 320.

6.3 Permutations

In Example | of the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible
arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS, ..., etc. Here, in this list, each
arrangement is different from other. In other words, the order of writing the letters is
important. Each arrangement is called a permutation of 4 different letters taken all
at a time. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without
meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the
repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements NUM,
NMU, MUN, NUB, ..., etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different
letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words = 6 x 5 x 4 = 120 (by using
multiplication principle).

If the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would
be 6 x 6 x 6=216.

Definition 1 A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of
objects taken some or all at a time.

In the following sub-section, we shall obtain the formula needed to answer these
questions immediately.

6.3.1 Permutations when all the objects are distinct

Theorem | The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time,
where 0 <7 <n and the objects do not repeat isn (n—1)(n-2)...(n-—r+ 1),
which is denoted by "P..

Proof There will be as many permutations as there are ways of filling in 7 vacant

the n objects. The first place can be filled in n ways; following which, the second place
can be filled in (7 — 1) ways, following which the third place can be filled in (” — 2)
ways,..., the 7th place can be filled in (#7 — (x — 1)) ways. Therefore, the number of
ways of filling in r vacant places in succession is n(n—1)(n—2)... (n—(r—1)) or
n(n-—1)(n—-2)...(n—r+ 1)

This expression for "P_is cumbersome and we need a notation which will help to
reduce the size of this expression. The symbol ! (read as factorial 1 or n factorial )
comes to our rescue. In the following text we will learn what actually ! means.

6.3.2. Factorial notation. The notation n! represents the product of first n natural
numbers, i.e., the product 1 x 2 x 3x... (n—1) x nis denoted as n!. We read this
symbol as ‘n factorial’. Thus, 1 x 2x3 x4... x(n-—1)xn=n!

1=1!

1x2=2!

1x2x3=3!

1x2x3x4=4! and so on.

We define 0! = 1
We can write 5!=5x4!=5x4x3!=5x4x3x2!

Clearly, for a natural number n
n! =n(n — 1)!

Counting permutations is merely counting the number of ways in which some or
all objects at a time are rearranged. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving
behind all the objects and we know that there is only one way of doing so. Thus, we

6.3.4 Permutations when all the objects are not distinct objects Suppose we have

Let us treat, temporarily, the 2 Os as different, say, O, and O,. The number of
permutations of 4-different letters, in this case, taken all at a time

Example 14 Find the number of different 8-letter arrangements that can be made

Solution (i) There are 8 different letters in the word DAUGHTER, in which there
are 3 vowels, namely, A, U and E. Since the vowels have to occur together, we can for
the time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with
5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations
of these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be °P, = 6!. Corresponding to
each of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E
taken all at a time . Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of
permutations = 6! x 3 ! = 4320.

(ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never
together, we first have to find all possible arrangments of 8 letters taken all at a time,
which can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number, the number
of permutations in which the vowels are always together.

Therefore, the required number 8!-—6!x3!= 6! (7x8-—6)

we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and Y with X will
not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many
hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time.

Seven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these
points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different
things taken 2 at a time.

Now, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of n different
objects taken r at a time, denoted by "C...

Suppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have
to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here, AB and BA are
the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not
included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations
of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., “C, = 6.

Corresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as
2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of
permutations = *C, x 21.

On the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at
a time = “P.,.
4! 4
Therefore ‘Pp, = 4C,x 2!) or (4=2)!2! ="G,

Now, let us suppose that we have 5 different objects A, B, C, D, E. Taking 3 ata
time, if we have to make combinations, these will be ABC, ABD, ABE, BCD, BCE,
CDE, ACE, ACD, ADE, BDE. Corresponding to each of these °C, combinations, there
are 3! permutations, because, the three objects in each combination can be

Therefore *P,=*°C,x 3! or (5-3)! 3! = G

These examples suggest the following theorem showing relationship between
permutaion and combination:

Theorem 5 "P.="C, r!,0<r<n.

Proof Corresponding to each combination of "C, we have r ! permutations, because
r objects in every combination can be rearranged in r ! ways.

the required number of words = 1” 60.

To get the number of words starting with A, we fix the letter A at the extreme left
position, we then rearrange the remaining 4 letters taken all at a time. There will be as
many arrangements of these 4 letters taken 4 at a time as there are permutations of 4

different things taken 4 at a time. Hence, the number of words starting with

4
A= 4! = 24. Then, starting with G, the number of words = 7 12 as after placing G

at the extreme left position, we are left with the letters A, A, I and N. Similarly, there
are 12 words starting with the next letter J. Total number of words so far obtained

Example 23 How many numbers greater than 1000000 can be formed by using the
digits 1,2,0,2,4, 2,4?

Solution Since, 1000000 is a 7-digit number and the number of digits to be used is also
7. Therefore, the numbers to be counted will be 7-digit only. Also, the numbers have to
be greater than 1000000, so they can begin either with 1, 2 or 4.

Historical Note

The concepts of permutations and combinations can be traced back to the advent
of Jainism in India and perhaps even earlier. The credit, however, goes to the
Jains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics,
under the name Vikalpa.

Among the Jains, Mahavira, (around 850) is perhaps the world’s first
mathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and
combinations.

In the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, Sushruta Samhita,
asserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a
time, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C.,
gives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number
of letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra.
Bhaskaracharya (born 1114) treated the subject matter of permutations and
combinations under the name Anka Pasha in his famous work Lilavati. In addition
to the general formulae for "C_ and "P already provided by Mahavira,
Bhaskaracharya gives several important theorems and results concerning the
subject.

Outside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its
humble beginnings in China in the famous book I-King (Book of changes). It is
difficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor
had ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately
was not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some
scattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations.

Some Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and
combinations in studying astronomy. Rabbi ben Ezra, for instance, determined
the number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time
and so on. This was around 1140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra did not know

Reprint 2025-26

PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS

the formula for "C.. However, he was aware that "C = "C__ for specific values
n andr. In 1321, Levi Ben Gerson, another Hebrew writer came up with the
formulae for "P_, "P_ and the general formula for "C.,

The first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of
permutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss, Jacob
Bernoulli (1654 — 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains
essentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today.
