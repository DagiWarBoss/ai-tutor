“¢ Geometry, as a logical system, is a means and even the most powerful
means to make children feel the strength of the human spirit that is
of their own spirit. — H. FREUDENTHAL*?

9.1 Introduction

We are familiar with two-dimensional coordinate geometry
from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of algebra
and geometry. A systematic study of geometry by the use
of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French
philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book
‘La Géometry, published in 1637. This book introduced the
notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical
methods into the study of geometry. The resulting
combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as
analytical geometry. In the earlier classes, we initiated
the study of coordinate geometry, where we studied about René Descartes
coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a (1596 -1650)
plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the
basics of coordinate geometry.

Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To
recapitulate, the location of the points (6, — 4) and
(3, 0) in the XY-plane is shown in Fig 9.1.

We may note that the point (6, — 4) is at 6 units
distance from the y-axis measured along the positive
x-axis and at 4 units distance from the x-axis
measured along the negative y-axis. Similarly, the 4----------
point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the y-axis
measured along the positive x-axis and has zero
distance from the x-axis.

We also studied there following important Fig 9.1
formulae:

Remark If the area of the triangle ABC is zero, then three points A, B and C lie on
a line, i.e., they are collinear.

In the this Chapter, we shall continue the study of coordinate geometry to study
properties of the simplest geometric figure — straight line. Despite its simplicity, the
line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous
interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically, for
which slope is most essential.

9.2 Slope of a Line
Aline in a coordinate plane forms two angles with the x-axis, which are supplementary.

Reprint 2025-26

STRAIGHT LINES 153

The angle (say) 8 made by the line / with positive
direction of x-axis and measured anti clockwise
is called the inclination of the line. Obviously
0° < O< 180° (Fig 9.2).

We observe that lines parallel to x-axis, or
coinciding with x-axis, have inclination of 0°. The
inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or
coinciding with y-axis) is 90°.

Definition 1 If 0 is the inclination of a line
/, then tan @ is called the slope or gradient of
the line /.

The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not
defined.

The slope of a line is denoted by m.

Thus, m = tan 0, 0 # 90°

It may be observed that the slope of x-axis is zero and slope of y-axis is not defined.

9.2.1 Slope of a line when coordinates.of any two points‘on the line are given
We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it.
Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a

line in terms of the coordinates of two points Y

on the line.

Let P(x,, y,) and Q(,, y,) be two
points on non-vertical line /whose inclination
is 8. Obviously, x, # x,, otherwise the line
will become perpendicular to x-axis and its
slope will not be defined. The inclination of
the line / may be acute or obtuse. Let us
take these two cases.

Draw perpendicular QR to x-axis and
PM perpendicular to RQ as shown in
Figs. 9.3 (i) and (11).

9.2.2 Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their
slopes In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical /ines /, and /, have slopes m,
and m,, respectively. Let their inclinations be o and Y
B, respectively.
If the line /, is parallel to /, (Fig 9.4), then their
inclinations are equal, 1.e.,

a = B, and hence, tan a = tan B

Therefore m,=™m,,1.¢., their slopes are equal.
Conversely, if the slope of two lines /, and /,

is same, 1.e.,

m,—m,.

Fig 9. 4

Then tan o = tan B.

By the property of tangent function (between 0° and 180°), a = B.
Therefore, the lines are parallel.

Reprint 2025-26

STRAIGHT LINES 155

Hence, two non vertical lines |, and 1, are parallel if and only if their slopes
are equal.

If the lines /, and /, are perpendicular (Fig 9.5), then B = a + 90°.
Therefore, tan B = tan (a + 90°)

Conversely, ifm, m, = —1,1e., tana tanB=— 1.

Then tan a =—cot B = tan (B + 90°) or tan (B — 90°)
Therefore, oa and B differ by 90°.
Thus, lines /, and /, are perpendicular to each other.

Hence, two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if
their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other,

9.2.3 Angle between two lines When we think about more than one line in a plane,
then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the

angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.
Let L, and L, be two non-vertical lines with slopes m, and m,, respectively. If o,
and ot, are the inclinations of lines L, and L,, respectively. Then

m, = tana, and m, = tana).

We know that when two lines intersect each other, they make two pairs of
vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°. Let 8 and
be the adjacent angles between the lines L, and L, (Fig 9.6). Then

0=a,-a,anda,a, # 90°.

9.3. Various Forms of the Equation of a Line

We know that every line ina plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship
between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:

How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that
for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.
Suppose P (x, y) is an arbitrary point in the X Y-plane and L is the given line. For the
equation of L, we wish to construct a statement or condition for the point P that is
true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic
equation involving the variables x and y. Now, we will discuss the equation of a line
under different conditions.

9.3.1 Horizontal and vertical lines If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-
axis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or — a [Fig 9.8 (a)].
Therefore, equation of the line L is either y= a or y =—a. Choice of sign will depend
upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly,
the equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or
x= —b [Fig 9.8(b)].

line L, whose slope is m. Let P (x, y) be an

Case I Suppose a line L with slope m cuts
the y-axis at a distance c from the origin
(Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the y-
intercept of the line L. Obviously,
coordinates of the point where the line meet
the y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m
and passes through a fixed point (0, c).
Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation
of Lis

y c=m(x 0) or y=mx+e

Thus, the point (x, v) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and

Note that the value of c will be positive or negative according as the intercept is made
on the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively.

Example 12 Find the distance of the line 4x — y = 0 from the point P (4, 1) measured
along the line making an angle of 135° with the positive x-axis.

Solution Given line is 4x -—y = 0 Y .. (1)
In order to find the distance of the
line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along
another line, we have to find the point
of intersection of both the lines. For
this purpose, we will first find the
equation of the second line
(Fig 9.16). Slope of second line is
tan 135° =—1. Equation of the line
with slope — 1 through the point
P (4, 1) is

Solving (1) and (2), we get x = 1 and y=4 so that point of intersection of the two lines
is Q (1, 4). Now, distance of line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along the line (2)
= the distance between the points P (4, 1) and Q (1, 4).

Let (4, k) is any point, whose distances from the lines (1) and (2) are equal. Therefore

Solving these two relations we get k= 0 or h = 3° Thus, the point (A, k) satisfies the

equations y = 0 or x = >, which represent straight lines. Hence, path of the point
