QI Structure of Amines

“The chief commercial use of amines is as intermediates in the
synthesis of medicines and fibres” .

Amines constitute an important class of organic
compounds derived by replacing one or more hydrogen
atoms of ammonia molecule by alkyl/aryl group(s). In
nature, they occur among proteins, vitamins, alkaloids
and hormones. Synthetic examples include polymers,
dye stuffs and drugs. Two biologically active
compounds, namely adrenaline and ephedrine, both
containing secondary amino group, are used to increase
blood pressure. Novocain, a synthetic amino compound,
is used as an anaesthetic in dentistry. Benadryl, a well
known antihistaminic drug also contains tertiary amino
group. Quaternary ammonium salts are used as
surfactants. Diazonium salts are intermediates in the
preparation of a_ variety of aromatic compounds
including dyes. In this Unit, you will learn about amines
and diazonium salts.

I. AMINES

Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia,
obtained by replacement of one, two or all the three
hydrogen atoms by alkyl and/or aryl groups.

For example:
CH;

CH,-NH,, C,H;-NH,, CH,-NH-CH,, CH,-N~

CH,

Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and
carries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals
in amines are therefore, sp? hybridised and the geometry
of amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp* hybridised
orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or
carbon depending upon the composition of the amines.
The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an
unshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of
unshared pair of electrons, the angle C-N-E, (where E is

Amines are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°) and tertiary (3°)
depending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or
aryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia
is replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH, or ArNH,, a primary amine (1°).
If two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH, are
replaced by another alkyl/aryl(R’)) group, what would you get? You
get R-NHR’, secondary amine. The second alkyl/aryl group may be
same or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl/aryl
group leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be
‘simple’ when all the alkyl or aryl groups are the same, and ‘mixed’
when they are different.

Primary(1°) Secondary(2°) Tertiary(3°)

In common system, an aliphatic amine is named by prefixing alkyl
group to amine, i.e., alkylamine as one word (e.g., methylamine). In
secondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same,
the prefix di or tri is appended before the name of alkyl group. In
IUPAC system, primary amines are named as alkanamines. The name
is derived by replacement of ‘e’ of alkane by the word amine. For
example, CH,NH, is named as methanamine. In case, more than one
amino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their
positions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing
-NH, groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. is attached to the
amine. The letter ‘e’ of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For
example, H,N-CH,-CH,-NH, is named as ethane-1, 2-diamine.

To name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate
substituent attached to a nitrogen atom. For example, CH, NHCH,CH, is

Reprint 2025-26

named as N-methylethanamine and (CH,CH,),N is named as N, N-
diethylethanamine. More examples are given in Table 9.1.

In arylamines, —NH, group is directly attached to the benzene ring.
C,H,NH, is the simplest example of arylamine. In common system, it
is known as aniline. It is also an accepted IUPAC name. While naming
arylamines according to IUPAC system, suffix ‘e’ of arene is replaced by
‘amine’. Thus in IUPAC system, C,H,-NH, is named as benzenamine.
Common and IUPAC names of some alkylamines and arylamines are
given in Table 9.1.

1. Reduction of nitro compounds

Nitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas
in the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and
also by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can
also be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines.

(i) Ethanol

(ii) an

Reduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because
FeCl, formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the
reaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required
to initiate the reaction.

. Ammonolysis of alkyl halides

You have read (Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in
alkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile. Hence,
an alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of
ammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the
halogen atom is replaced by an amino (-NH,) group. This process of
cleavage of the C-—X bond by ammonia molecule is known as
ammonolysis. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373
K. The primary amine thus obtained behaves as a nucleophile and
can further react with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary
amines, and finally quaternary ammonium salt.

Ammonolysis has the disadvantage of yielding a mixture of primary,

However, primary amine is obtained as a major product by taking
large excess of ammonia.

The order of reactivity of halides with amines is RI > RBr >RCl.

Gabriel phthalimide synthesis

Gabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of primary amines.
Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic potassium hydroxide forms
potassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide
followed by alkaline hydrolysis produces the corresponding primary
amine. Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this method
because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with
the anion formed by phthalimide.

. Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction

Hoffmann developed a method for preparation of primary amines by
treating an amide with bromine in an aqueous or ethanolic solution
of sodium hydroxide. In this degradation reaction, migration of an
alkyl or aryl group takes place from carbonyl carbon of the amide
to the nitrogen atom. The amine so formed contains one carbon less
than that present in the amide.

Q.5 Dhysical The lower aliphatic amines are gases with fishy odour. Primary amines

with three or more carbon atoms are liquid and still higher ones are
solid. Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but get
coloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation.

Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases
with increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the
hydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water.
Considering the electronegativity of nitrogen of amine and oxygen of
alcohol as 3.0 and 3.5 respectively, you can predict the pattern of
solubility of amines and alcohols in water. Out of butan-1l-ol and
butan-1-amine, which will be more soluble in water and why? Amines
are soluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether and benzene. You
may remember that alcohols are more polar than amines and form
stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than amines.

Primary and secondary amines are engaged in intermolecular
association due to hydrogen bonding between nitrogen of one and
hydrogen of another molecule. This intermolecular association is more
in primary amines than in secondary amines as there are two hydrogen
atoms available for hydrogen bond formation in it. Tertiary amines do
not have intermolecular association due to the absence of hydrogen
atom available for hydrogen bond formation. Therefore, the order of
boiling points of isomeric amines is as follows:

Amine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH, regenerate the
parent amine.

RNH, X + OH —> RNH,+H,0+X

Amine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents
like ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from
the non basic organic compounds insoluble in water.

The reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts
shows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair
of electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis base.
Basic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their K,
and pK, values as explained below:

Larger the value of K, or smaller the value of pK,, stronger is the
base. The pK, values of few amines are given in Table 9.3.

pK, value of ammonia is 4.75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases
than ammonia due to +I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron
density on the nitrogen atom. Their pK, values lie in the range of 3 to
4.22. On the other hand, aromatic amines are weaker bases than
ammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group.

You may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the K,
values of amines on the basis of +I or -I effect of the substituents
present in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like
solvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength
of amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following
paragraphs.

Structure-basicity relationship of amines

Basicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of
an amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by
accepting a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is
relative to the amine, more basic is the amine.

(a) Alkanamines versus ammonia

Let us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with
a proton to compare their basicity.

H H

if ¥, [,
RON: +H = RON -H

H H

H H

if \, l
HON: +H =a i —-H

H H

Due to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it pushes
electrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron
pair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover,
the substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised
due to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl
group. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia.
Thus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with
increase in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in
the gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous
phase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine
> primary amine > NH,. The trend is not regular in the aqueous
state as evident by their pK, values given in Table 9.3. In the
aqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised
not only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also
by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion,
lesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The
order of stability of ions are as follows:

OH,
H
R H-- OH R
a \ +7 > \t+
RN —H-OH, > IX _N-H-~ OH,
H R’ ‘H~OH, RY
OH,
1° 2° 38°

Decreasing order of extent of H-bonding in water and order of
stability of ions by solvation.

Reprint 2025-26

Greater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger
should be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity
of aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which
is opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the
alkyl group is small, like -CH, group, there is no steric hindrance to
H-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH, group, there will
be steric hinderance to H-bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of
the alkyl group, e.g., from —CH, to -C,H, results in change of the order
of basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive
effect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which
decides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The
order of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl
substituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:

(C,H,),NH > (C,H,),N > C,H,NH, > NH,

(CH,),NH > CH,NH, > (CH,),N > NH,

(b) Arylamines versus ammonia

pK, value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in
aniline or other arylamines, the -NH, group is attached directly to
the benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen
atom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making
it less available for protonation. If you write different resonating
structures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance
hybrid of the following five structures.

On the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton
can have only two resonating structures (kekule).

We know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater
is the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline (five resonating
structures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton
acceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines
would be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it
is observed that electron releasing groups like -OCH,, —CH, increase

basic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like —NO,, -SO,H,
—COOH, -X decrease it.

2. Alkylation

Amines undergo alkylation on reaction with alkyl halides (refer Unit
6, Class XII).

3.Acylation

Aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines react with
acid chlorides, anhydrides and esters by nucleophilic substitution
reaction. This reaction is known as acylation. You can consider
this reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of -NH, or >N-H
group by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction
are known as amides. The reaction is carried out in the presence of
a base stronger than the amine, like pyridine, which removes HCl so
formed and shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side.

in a different manner is used for the distinction of primary,
secondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a
mixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl
chloride is replaced by p-toluenesulphonyl chloride.

7. Electrophilic substitution
You have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five
structures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in
these structures? Ortho- and para-positions to the -NH, group
become centres of high electron density. Thus —NH, group is ortho
and para directing and a powerful activating group.

The main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution
reactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity.
Substitution tends to occur at ortho- and para-positions. If we
have to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can
the activating effect of -NH, group be controlled ? This can be
done by protecting the -NH, group by acetylation with acetic
anhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed
by hydrolysis of the spouted amide to the substituted amine.

Hence, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is less available for
donation to benzene ring by resonance. Therefore, activating
effect of -NHCOCH, group is less than that of amino group.

Nitration: Direct nitration of aniline yields tarry oxidation
products in addition to the nitro derivatives. Moreover, in the
strongly acidic medium, aniline is protonated to form the
anilinium ion which is meta directing. That is why besides the
ortho and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative
is also formed.

Sulphonation: Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid
to form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with
sulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic
acid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product.

Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and
acetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the
Lewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of
aniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong
deactivating group for further reaction.

II. DIAZONIUM SALTS
The diazonium salts have the general formula RNo X where R stands

for an aryl group and x ion may be CI Br, HSO;,. BF, . etc. They are

named by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon
from which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as

chloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The N, group is called diazonium

group. For example, C,H, No C] is named as benzenediazonium

chloride and C,H,N,HSO, is known as benzenediazonium
hydrogensulphate.

Primary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts
(refer to Section 9.6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazonium
salts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures
(273-278 K). The stability of arenediazonium ion is explained on the

basis of resonance.

Salts as diazotisation. Due to its instability, the diazonium salt is not
generally stored and is used immediately after its preparation.

Properties

Q.Q Chemical

Reactions

Benzenediazonium chloride is a colourless crystalline solid. It is readily
soluble in water and is stable in cold but reacts with water when
warmed. It decomposes easily in the dry state. Benzenediazonium
fluoroborate is water insoluble and stable at room temperature.

The reactions of diazonium salts can be broadly divided into two
categories, namely (A) reactions involving displacement of nitrogen and
(B) reactions involving retention of diazo group.

A. Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen

Diazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted

by other groups such as Cl, Br I CN and OH which displace

nitrogen from the aromatic ring. The nitrogen formed escapes from

the reaction mixture as a gas.

1. Replacement by halide or cyanide ion: The Cl, Br and CN”
nucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring in the
presence of Cu(I) ion. This reaction is called Sandmeyer reaction.

ArN,X CwBr/ABr . arBr +. N,
CuCN /KCN
a ArCN + N,

Alternatively, chlorine or bromine can also be introduced in the
benzene ring by treating the diazonium salt solution with corresponding
halogen acid in the presence of copper powder. This is referred as
Gatterman reaction.

Cu/HCl

_— ArCl + N, + CuX
ArN,X Cu/HB

The yield in Sandmeyer reaction is found to be better than
Gattermann reaction.

2. Replacement by iodide ion: Iodine is not easily introduced into
the benzene ring directly, but, when the diazonium salt solution
is treated with potassium iodide, iodobenzene is formed.

ArN,Cl + KI —> Arl + KCl + N,
3. Replacement by fluoride ion: When arenediazonium chloride is
treated with fluoroboric acid, arene diazonium fluoroborate is
precipitated which on heating decomposes to yield aryl fluoride.

+ = + =
ArN,Cl + HBF, —> Ar—N,BF, > Ar—F + BF,+ N,

4. Replacement by H: Certain mild reducing agents like
hypophosphorous acid (phosphinic acid) or ethanol reduce
diazonium salts to arenes and themselves get oxidised to
phosphorous acid and ethanal, respectively.

5. Replacement by hydroxyl group: If the temperature of the
diazonium salt solution is allowed to rise upto 283 K, the salt
gets hydrolysed to phenol.

ArN,Cl + H,O —> ArOH + N, + HCl

6. Replacement by —NO, group: When diazonium fluoroborate is
heated with aqueous sodium nitrite solution in the presence of
copper, the diazonium group is replaced by —NO, group.

B. Reactions involving retention of diazo group
coupling reactions

The azo products obtained have an extended conjugate system having
both the aromatic rings joined through the -N=N- bond. These compounds
are often coloured and are used as dyes. Benzene diazonium chloride
reacts with phenol in which the phenol molecule at its para position is
coupled with the diazonium salt to form p-hydroxyazobenzene. This
type of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of
diazonium salt with aniline yields p-aminoazobenzene. This is an example
of electrophilic substitution reaction.

From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very
good intermediates for the introduction of -F, —Cl, —Br, -I, -CN, —OH,
-NO, groups into the aromatic ring.

Aryl fluorides and iodides cannot be prepared by direct halogenation.
The cyano group cannot be introduced by nucleophilic substitution of
chlorine in chlorobenzene but cyanobenzene can be easily obtained
from diazonium salt.

Thus, the replacement of diazo group by other groups is helpful in

preparing those substituted aromatic compounds which cannot be
prepared by direct substitution in benzene or substituted benzene.

Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia obtained by replacement of
hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. Replacement of one hydrogen atom of
ammonia gives rise to structure of the type R-NH,, known as primary amine.
Secondary amines are characterised by the structure R,NH or R-NHR’ and tertiary
amines by R,N, RNR'R” or R,NR’. Secondary and tertiary amines are known as
simple amines if the alkyl or aryl groups are the same and mixed amines if the
groups are different. Like ammonia, all the three types of amines have one unshared
electron pair on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis bases.

Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, imides, etc.
They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influence their physical properties. In
alkylamines, a combination of electron releasing, steric and H-bonding factors
influence the stability of the substituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents
and thus affect the basic nature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger
bases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups,
respectively increase and decrease their basic character. Aniline is a weaker base

(277 Amines

than ammonia. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair
of electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom
on the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and
distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. p-Toluenesulphonyl chloride
is used for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Presence of
amino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of the aromatic amines. Reactivity of
aromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process, i.e., by treating with acetyl
chloride or acetic anhydride. Tertiary amines like trimethylamine are used as insect
attractants.

Aryldiazonium salts, usually obtained from arylamines, undergo replacement of
the diazonium group with a variety of nucleophiles to provide advantageous methods
for producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by reductive removal of the
diazo group. Coupling reaction of aryldiazonium salts with phenols or arylamines give
rise to the formation of azo dyes.
