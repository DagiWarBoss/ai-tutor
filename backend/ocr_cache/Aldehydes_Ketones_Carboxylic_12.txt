Carbonyl compounds are of utmost importance to organic
chemistry. They are constituents of fabrics, flavourings, plastics
and drugs.

In the previous Unit, you have studied organic
compounds with functional groups containing carbon-
oxygen single bond. In this Unit, we will study about the
organic compounds containing carbon-oxygen double
bond (>C=O) called carbonyl group, which is one of the
most important functional groups in organic chemistry.

In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is bonded to a
carbon and hydrogen while in the ketones, it is bonded
to two carbon atoms. The carbonyl compounds in which
carbon of carbonyl group is bonded to carbon or
hydrogen and oxygen of hydroxyl moiety (-OH) are
known as carboxylic acids, while in compounds where
carbon is attached to carbon or hydrogen and nitrogen
of -NH, moiety or to halogens are called amides and
acyl halides respectively. Esters and anhydrides are
derivatives of carboxylic acids. The general formulas of
these classes of compounds are given below:

Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are widespread in plants
and animal kingdom. They play an important role in biochemical
processes of life. They add fragrance and flavour to nature, for example,
vanillin (from vanilla beans), salicylaldehyde (from meadow sweet) and
cinnamaldehyde (from cinnamon) have very pleasant fragrances.

I. Aldehydes and ketones

Aldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl
compounds.
There are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.

(a) Common names

Aldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names
instead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are
derived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic
acids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending —ic of acid with aldehyde.
At the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the
original source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent
in the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, B, y, 5, etc. The
a-carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group, B-
carbon the next, and so on. For example

CHO ir 1
CH,CHO H,C— CH —CH,— C—H
Y B OL
Acetaldehyde Benzaldehyde B-Bromobutyraldehyde

Reprint 2025-26

The common names of Ketones are derived by naming two alkyl
or aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group. The locations of
substituents are indicated by Greek letters, a a’, B B’ and so on
beginning with the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group,
indicated as aa’. Some ketones have historical common names,
the simplest dimethyl ketone is called acetone. Alkyl phenyl
ketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as
prefix to the word phenone. For example

1

i

Acetone Acetophenone Propiophenone Benzophenone

(b) IUPAC names

The IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones
are derived from the names of the corresponding alkanes by
replacing the ending —e with —al and —one respectively. In case of
aldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the
carbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the
numbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The
substituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals
indicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to
cyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When
the aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde
is added after the full name of the cycloalkane. The numbering of
the ring carbon atoms start from the carbon atom attached to the
aldehyde group. The name of the simplest aromatic aldehyde
carrying the aldehyde group on a benzene ring is
benzenecarbaldehyde. However, the common name benzaldehyde
is also accepted by IUPAC. Other aromatic aldehydes are hence
named as substituted benzaldehydes.

8.1.2 Structure of | The carbonyl carbon atom is sp-hybridised and forms three sigma (o)

the bonds. The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its p-orbital
Carbonyl and forms a z-bond with oxygen by overlap with p-orbital of an oxygen.
Group In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs.

Thus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the
same plane and the z-electron cloud is above and below this plane. The
bond angles are approximately 120° as expected of a trigonal coplanar
structure (Figure 8.1).

Fig.8.1 Orbital diagram for the formation of carbonyl group

The carbon-oxygen double bond is polarised due to higher
electronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Hence, the carbonyl

. From hydrocarbons

Aromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde and its derivatives) are prepared
from aromatic hydrocarbons by the following methods:

(@) By oxidation of methylbenzene
Strong oxidising agents oxidise toluene and its derivatives to
benzoic acids. However, it is possible to stop the oxidation at
the aldehyde stage with suitable reagents that convert the methyl
group to an intermediate that is difficult to oxidise further. The
following methods are used for this purpose.

(a) Use of chromyl chloride (CrO,Cl,): Chromyl chloride oxidises
methyl group to a chromium complex, which on hydrolysis
gives corresponding benzaldehyde.

8.3 Physical fa physical properties of aldehydes and ketones are described as
Properties Ones:

Methanal is a gas at room temperature. Ethanal is a volatile liquid.
Other aldehydes and ketones are liquid or solid at room temperature.
The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than
hydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to
weak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the
dipole-dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those
of alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding. The following compounds of molecular masses 58
and 60 are ranked in order of increasing boiling points.

b.p.(K) Molecular Mass

n-Butane 273 58
Methoxyethane 281 60
Propanal 322 58
Acetone 329 58
Propan-1-ol 370 60

The lower members of aldehydes and ketones such as methanal,
ethanal and propanone are miscible with water in all proportions,
because they form hydrogen bond with water.

However, the solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly
on increasing the length of alkyl chain. All aldehydes and ketones are
fairly soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether, methanol,
chloroform, etc. The lower aldehydes have sharp pungent odours. As
the size of the molecule increases, the odour becomes less pungent
and more fragrant. In fact, many naturally occurring aldehydes and
ketones are used in the blending of perfumes and flavouring agents.

Arrange the following compounds in the increasing order of their Example 8.2
boiling points:

CH,CH,CH,CHO, CH,CH,CH,CH,OH, H,C,-O-C,H,, CH,CH,CH,CH,

The molecular masses of these compounds are in the range of 72 to Solution
74. Since only butan-1-ol molecules are associated due to extensive
intermolecular hydrogen bonding, therefore, the boiling point of
butan-1l-ol would be the highest. Butanal is more polar than
ethoxyethane. Therefore, the intermolecular dipole-dipole attraction

is stronger in the former. n-Pentane molecules have only weak van

der Waals forces. Hence increasing order of boiling points of the

given compounds is as follows:

CH,CH,CH,CH, < H,C,-O-C,H, < CH,CH,CH,CHO < CH,CH,CH,CH,OH

group, they undergo similar chemical reactions.

1. Nucleophilic addition reactions

Contrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes, the
aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.

() Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions

A nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar
carbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular
to the plane of sp’ hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon (Fig.
8.2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from sp’ to sp” in
this process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is
produced. This intermediate captures a proton from the
reaction medium to give
the electrically neutral
product. The net result is

Fig.8.2: Nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon

(ii) Reactivity

Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in
nucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic
reasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large
substituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to
carbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such
substituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than
ketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of
the carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former.

Example 8.3 Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in
nucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer.

Solution The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less
electrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in

0 propanal. The polarity of the carbonyl

group is reduced in benzaldehyde due

3. Oxidation

Aldehydes differ from ketones in their oxidation reactions. Aldehydes
are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids on treatment with common
oxidising agents like nitric acid, potassium permanganate, potassium
dichromate, etc. Even mild oxidising agents, mainly Tollens’ reagent
and Fehlings’ reagent also oxidise aldehydes.
R-CHO Hl R-COOH
Ketones are generally oxidised under vigorous conditions, i.e.,
strong oxidising agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation
involves carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic
acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone.

sodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions

An organic compound (A) with molecular formula C,H,O forms an
orange-red precipitate with 2,4-DNP reagent and gives yellow
precipitate on heating with iodine in the presence of sodium

it decolourise bromine water or Baeyer’s reagent. On drastic oxidation

formula C_H,O,. Identify the compounds (A) and (B) and explain the

(A) forms 2,4-DNP derivative. Therefore, it is an aldehyde or a ketone.
Since it does not reduce Tollens’ or Fehling reagent, (A) must be a ketone.
(A) responds to iodoform test. Therefore, it should be a methyl ketone.
The molecular formula of (A) indicates high degree of unsaturation, yet
it does not decolourise bromine water or Baeyer’s reagent. This indicates
the presence of unsaturation due to an aromatic ring.

Compound (B), being an oxidation product of a ketone should be a
carboxylic acid. The molecular formula of (B) indicates that it should
be benzoic acid and compound (A) should, therefore, be a
monosubstituted aromatic methyl ketone. The molecular formula of
(A) indicates that it should be phenyl methyl ketone (acetophenone).

4. Reactions due to a-hydrogen

Acidity of a-hydrogens of aldehydes and ketones: The aldehydes
and ketones undergo a number of reactions due to the acidic nature
of a-hydrogen.

The acidity of o-hydrogen atoms of carbonyl compounds is due
to the strong electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group and
resonance stabilisation of the conjugate base.

The aldol and ketol readily lose water to give a,f-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds which are aldol condensation products
and the reaction is called Aldol condensation. Though ketones
give ketols (compounds containing a keto and alcohol groups),

Carboxylic Acids

Carbon compounds containing a carboxyl functional group, -COOH are
called carboxylic acids. The carboxyl group, consists of a carbonyl group
attached to a hydroxyl group, hence its name carboxyl. Carboxylic acids
may be aliphatic (RCOOH) or aromatic (ArCOOH) depending on the group,
alkyl or aryl, attached to carboxylic carbon. Large number of carboxylic
acids are found in nature. Some higher members of aliphatic carboxylic
acids (C,,— C,,) known as fatty acids, occur in natural fats as esters of
glycerol. Carboxylic acids serve as starting material for several other
important organic compounds such as anhydrides, esters, acid chlorides,
amides, etc.

8.0 TVlomenclature and Structure of Carboxyl Group

8.6.1 Since carboxylic acids are amongst the earliest organic compounds to

Nomenclature be isolated from nature, a large number of them are known by their
common names. The common names end with the suffix -ic acid and
have been derived from Latin or Greek names of their natural sources.
For example, formic acid (HCOOH) was first obtained from red ants
(Latin: formica means ant), acetic acid (CH;COOH) from vinegar (Latin:
acetum, means vinegar), butyric acid (CH;CH,CH,COOH) from rancid
butter (Latin: butyrum, means butter).

In the IUPAC system, aliphatic carboxylic acids are named by
replacing the ending —-e in the name of the corresponding alkane with -
oic acid. In numbering the carbon chain, the carboxylic carbon is
numbered one. For naming compounds containing more than one
carboxyl group, the alkyl chain leaving carboxyl groups is numbered
and the number of carboxyl groups is indicated by adding the
multiplicative prefix, dicarboxylic acid, tricarboxylic acid, etc. to the name
of parent alkyl chain. The position of -COOH groups are indicated by the
arabic numeral before the multiplicative prefix. Some of the carboxylic
acids along with their common and IUPAC names are listed in Table 8.3.

Carboxylic acids are also prepared from aldehydes by the use of
mild oxidising agents (Section 8.4).

. From alkylbenzenes

Aromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of
alkyl benzenes with chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium
permanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to the carboxyl group
irrespective of length of the side chain. Primary and secondary alkyl
groups are oxidised in this manner while tertiary group is not affected.
Suitably substituted alkenes are also oxidised to carboxylic acids
with these oxidising reagents.

carboxylic acids having one carbon atom more than that present in
alkyl halides (ascending the series).

5. From acyl halides and anhydrides

Acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give carboxylic acids or more
readily hydrolysed with aqueous base to give carboxylate ions which on
acidification provide corresponding carboxylic acids. Anhydrides on the

where K,,, is equilibrium constant and K, is the acid dissociation

For convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by
its pK, value rather than its K, value.

pk, =-— log K,

The pK, of hydrochloric acid is -7.0, where as pK, of trifluoroacetic
acid (the strongest carboxylic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are
0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively.

Smaller the pK,, the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton
donor). Strong acids have pK, values < 1, the acids with pK, values
between 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak
acids have pK, values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids
have pK, values >15.

Carboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger
acids than alcohols and many simple phenols (pK, is ~16 for ethanol
and 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic
organic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why
phenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic
acids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate
base of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent
resonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more
electronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide
ion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge
is at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in
phenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the
negative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in
carboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen
atom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 7,
Class XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide
ion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols.

Effect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids:
Substituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus,
also affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing
groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the
conjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by
inductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups
decrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base.

The effect of the following groups in increasing acidity order is

Direct attachment of groups such as phenyl or vinyl to the carboxylic
acid, increases the acidity of corresponding carboxylic acid, contrary to
the decrease expected due to resonance effect shown below:

This is because of greater electronegativity of sp” hybridised carbon

their acidity while electron donating groups decrease their acidity.

Mechanism of esterification of carboxylic acids: The esterification of carboxylic
acids with alcohols is a kind of nucleophilic acyl substitution. Protonation of the
carbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the
alcohol. Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group
into —'OH, group, which, being a better leaving group, is eliminated as neutral water
molecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester.

Summar

Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are some of the important classes of
organic compounds containing carbonyl group. These are highly polar molecules.
Therefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly
polar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses. The lower
members are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water.
The higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms,
are insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. Aldehydes are
prepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and
controlled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be
prepared by oxidation of (i) methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or CrO, in the
presence of acetic anhydride, (ii) formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and
hydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and (iii) cuprous
chloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride. Ketones are prepared by oxidation of
secondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction
of acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium. A good method for the preparation of aromatic
ketones is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides
or anhydrides. Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes.
Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl
group with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, NaHSOs;, alcohols (or diols),

ammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The a-hydrogens in aldehydes and
ketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one a-hydrogen,
undergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give o-hydroxyaldehydes
(aldol) and a-hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively. Aldehydes having no a-hydrogen
undergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes
and ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH,, LiAlH,, or by catalytic hydrogenation.
The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group
by Clemmensen reduction or Wolff-Kishner reduction. Aldehydes are easily
oxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens’ reagent and
Fehling’s reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from
ketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes
and alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with
carbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation
of alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and
most of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH,,
or better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo a-halogenation with Cl,
and Br, in the presence of red phosphorus (Hell-Volhard Zelinsky reaction).
Methanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic
acid are highly useful compounds in industry.
