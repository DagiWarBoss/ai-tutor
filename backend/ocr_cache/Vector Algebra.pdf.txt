10.1 Introduction

In our day to day life, we come across many queries such {pete bhi es eh
as — What is your height? How should a football player hit

the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe
that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,
a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which
is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars.
However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called
force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and
direction (in which another player is positioned). Such
quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and
engineering, we frequently come across with both types of

W.R. Hamilton
(1805-1865)

quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass,
time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,
money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity,
acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.

In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various
operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of
properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,
and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.

10.2 Some Basic Concepts

Let ‘7 be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given
two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed
is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)).

Fig 10.1
Now observe that if we restrict the line / to the line segment AB, then a magnitude
is prescribed on the line / with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed

line segment (Fig 10.1(i1i)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as
direction.

Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector.
Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as AB or
simply as G, and read as ‘vector AB’ or ‘vector @’.
The point A from where the vector AB starts is called its initial point, and the

point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and
terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as

IABI, or Idl, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.

Since the length is never negative, the notation Id! < 0 has no meaning.

Position Vector
From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system
(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to

the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector OP having O and P as its initial and terminal
points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect

to O. Using distance formula (from Class XD), the magnitude of OP (or 7) is given by

lOPI= fx? + y? +27
In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O

are denoted by a, b,c, etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).

Direction Cosines

Consider the position vector OP (or r ) of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles a,
B, y made by the vector / with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively,
are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cos, cos B and
cos y are called direction cosines of the vector 7, and usually denoted by /, m and n,
respectively.

Fig 10.3 “ay
From Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we

have cosa =~ (r stands for |7|). Similarly, from the right angled triangles OBP and
r

OCP, we may write cos B = * and cos y= s Thus, the coordinates of the point P may
r r

also be expressed as (/r, mr,nr). The numbers /r, mr and nr, proportional to the direction
cosines are called as direction ratios of vector 7, and denoted as a, b and c, respectively.

10.3 Types of Vectors

Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector
(or null vector), and denoted as 0. Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction
as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any

direction. The vectors AA, BB represent the zero vector,

Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (1.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The

unit vector in the direction of a given vector d is denoted by a.

Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial

vectors.

Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to

the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.

Equal Vectors Two vectors a and b are said to be equal, if they have the same
magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written
as G=b.

Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector

(say, AB), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector.

For example, vector BA is negative of the vector AB, and written as BA = — AB.

Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its
parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are

called free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only.

10.4 Addition of Vectors Cc

A vector AB simply means the displacement from a point
A to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl
moves from A to B and then from B to C
(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from
point A to the point C, is given by the vector AC and A

expressed as Fig 10.7

AC = AB + BC
This is known as the triangle law of vector addition.

In general, if we have two vectors 4 and b (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are
positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other
(Fig 10.8(ii)).

(i) (ii)

Fig 10.8

For example, in Fig 10.8 (ii), we have shifted vector b without changing its magnitude
and direction, so that it’s initial point coincides with the terminal point of a. Then, the

vector G + b, represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or
resultant) of the vectors @ and 6 ie., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have
AB + BC = AC
Now again, since AC = —CA, from the above equation, we have

AB+BC+CA = AA =0
This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero
resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(ii1)).

Reprint 2025-26

344 MATHEMATICS

Now, construct a vector BC’ so that its magnitude is same as the vector BC, but the
direction opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (iii), i-e.,
BC’ = -BC
Then, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (iii), we have

AC' = AB+BC' = AB+(-BC) =4-b

The vector AC’ is said to represent the difference of a and b.

Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a
direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity
vectors—one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the
velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two
velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise
idea about the effective speed and direction
(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have
the following law of vector addition.

If we havetwo vectors @ and b represented
by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram
in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their
sum a+b is represented in magnitude and

direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram

through their common point. This is known as

the parallelogram law of vector addition.

From Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that
OA+ AC =OC

or OA + OB =O0C (since AC = OB )

which is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector
addition are equivalent to each other.

Proof Consider the parallelogram ABCD
(Fig 10.10). Let AB = @ and BC = 5, then using
the triangle law, from triangle ABC, we have

AC =a+b
Now, since the opposite sides of a

parallelogram are equal and parallel, from

—. Fig 10.10
DC = AB =a. Again using triangle law, from 6

AC =AD+ DC=b+a
Hence a@+b=b+a
Property 2 For any three vectors a,b andc

shown in Fig 10.11(4) and (ii).

and a+(b+¢)=PQ+QS=PS
Hence (4+b)+€=a+(b+C)
Remark The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of
three vectors a,b, é as @+b + é without using brackets.
Note that for any vector qa, we have
a+0=0+a=4
Here, the zero vector 0 is called the additive identity for the vector addition.

10.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar

Let a be a given vector and i a scalar. Then the product of the vector a by the scalar
A, denoted as Ad, is called the multiplication of vector @ by the scalar A. Note that, Ad
is also a vector, collinear to the vector d. The vector Ad has the direction same (or
opposite) to that of vector 4 according as the value of A is positive (or negative). Also,
the magnitude of vector Ad is |A| times the magnitude of the vector 4, i.e.,
IAdl =1Allal

A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given

in Fig 10.12.

When A = —1, then Ad= — 4, which is a vector having magnitude equal to the

magnitude of 4 and direction opposite to that of the direction of 4. The vector —4 is
called the negative (or additive inverse) of vector 4 and we always have

So, A @ represents the unit vector in the direction of 4. We write it as

10.5.1 Components of a vector
Let us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(O, 1, 0) and C(O, 0, 1) on the x-axis, y-axis and
z-axis, respectively. Then, clearly

IOAI= 1, |OB |= 1 and lOCI= 1

The vectors OA, OB and OC, each having magnitude 1,
are called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ,

respectively, and denoted by 7,7 and k, respectively
(Fig 10.13).

Now, consider the position vector OP of a point P(x, y, z)
as in Fig 10.14. Let P, be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY.

Fig 10.13

x Fig 10.14

We, thus, see that P, P is parallel to z-axis. As i ; j and k are the unit vectors along the
x, y and z-axes, respectively, and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have
PP=OR = ck, Similarly, QP, = OS = yj and OQ = xi.

Reprint 2025-26

348 MATHEMATICS

Therefore, it follows that OP, =0Q+QP, =xi+ yj
and OP = OP, + RP=xi+ yj+zk
Hence, the position vector of P with reference to O is given by
OP (or F)-xi + yj tczk
This form of any vector is called its component form. Here, x, y and z are called

as the scalar components of 7, and xi, yj and zk are called the vector components

of * along the respective axes. Sometimes x, y and z are also termed as rectangular
components.

The length of any vector 7 = xi + yj+ zk , is readily determined by applying the
Pythagoras theorem twice. We note that in the right angle triangle OQP, (Fig 10.14)
OP, |= //OQ/+QR)° = Vx? + y?>
and in the right angle triangle OPP, we have

OP = J|OPf +/RPP = ye +y%) +27
Hence, the length of any vector 7 = xi + yjtzk is given by

If @ and b are any two vectors given in the component form ai + dy j tayk and
bi + b,j + bk , respectively, then
(i) the sum (or resultant) of the vectors a and b is given by
G+b = (a, +bi + (ay +by)j + (a; +b, dk
(ii) the difference of the vector d and b is given by
a—b = (a —b,)i + (a, —by)j + (a, —b,)k
(iii) the vectors a and b are equal if and only if
ad,=b,,4,=b, and a,=b,

10.5.3 Section formula
Let P and Q be two points represented by the position vectors OP and OQ, respectively,
with respect to the origin O. Then the line segment
joining the points P and Q may be divided by a third
point, say R, in two ways — internally (Fig 10.16)
and externally (Fig 10.17). Here, we intend to find
the position vector OR for the point R with respect
to the origin O. We take the two cases one by one.

Case I When R divides PQ internally (Fig 10.16).
If R divides PQ such that m RQ = 7 PR, Fig 10.16

where m and n are positive scalars, we say that the point R divides PQ internally in the
ratio of m:n. Now from triangles ORQ and OPR, we have

RQ = 0Q-OR =b-r

10.6 Product of Two Vectors

So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors. An other algebraic
operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may
recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a
matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely,
multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly,
multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot)
product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the
result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have
found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section,
we will discuss these two types of products.

Historical Note

The word vector has been derived from a Latin word vectus, which means
“to carry”. The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800
when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described
that how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with
the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton
(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a
directed line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’s
method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:

at+bi+c+ dk, i, hs k following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the

problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must
mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was
known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek
philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be
known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding
them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of
forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular
forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of
geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst
(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the
development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept
of vectors to form.

In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and
mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created
what we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar)
