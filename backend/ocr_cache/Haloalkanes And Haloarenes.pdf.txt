Halalkanesrana
Haloarenes

Halogenated compounds persist in the environment due to their
resistance to breakdown by soil bacteria.

The replacement of hydrogen atom(s) in an aliphatic
or aromatic hydrocarbon by halogen atom(s) results
in the formation of alkyl halide (haloalkane) and aryl
halide (haloarene), respectively. Haloalkanes contain
halogen atom(s) attached to the sp? hybridised carbon
atom of an alkyl group whereas haloarenes contain
halogen atom(s) attached to sp? hybridised carbon
atom(s) of an aryl group. Many halogen containing
organic compounds occur in nature and some of
these are clinically useful. These classes of compounds
find wide applications in industry as well as in day-
to-day life. They are used as solvents for relatively
non-polar compounds and as starting materials for
the synthesis of wide range of organic compounds.
Chlorine containing antibiotic, chloramphenicol,
produced by microorganisms is very effective for the
treatment of typhoid fever. Our body produces iodine
containing hormone, thyroxine, the deficiency of which
causes a disease called goiter. Synthetic halogen
compounds, viz. chloroquine is used for the treatment
of malaria; halothane is used as an anaesthetic
during surgery. Certain fully fluorinated compounds
are being considered as potential blood substitutes
in surgery.

In this Unit, you will study the important methods
of preparation, physical and chemical properties and
uses of organohalogen compounds.

Haloalkanes and haloarenes may be classified as follows:

compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen
atoms in their structures. For example,

Monohalocompounds may further be classified according to the
hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the halogen is bonded, as
discussed below.

This class includes

(a) Alkyl halides or haloalkanes (R—X)

In alkyl halides, the halogen atom is bonded to an alkyl group (R).
They form a homologous series represented by C,H,,,,X. They are
further classified as primary, secondary or tertiary according to the
nature of carbon to which halogen is attached. If halogen is attached to
a primary carbon atom in an alkyl halide, the alkyl halide is called
primary alkyl halide or 1° alkyl halide. Similarly, if halogen is attached
to secondary or tertiary carbon atom, the alkyl halide is called
secondary alkyl halide (2°) and tertiary (3°) alkyl halide, respectively.

0.2 Mlomenclature Having learnt the classification of halogenated compounds, let us now learn
how these are named. The common names of alkyl halides are derived by
naming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system
of nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons.
For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC
names are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the prefixes o-, m-, p- are
used in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class

As we go down the group in the periodic table, the size of halogen
atom increases. Fluorine atom is the smallest and iodine atom is the
largest. Consequently the carbon-halogen bond length also increases

Hydrocarbons

Chemistry piGdy

The hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with
concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides or thionyl chloride.
Thionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed
along with gases SO, and HCl. The two gaseous products are escapable,
hence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and
secondary alcohols with HCl require the presence of a catalyst, ZnCl.,.
With tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the
alcohol with concentrated HCl at room temperature. Constant boiling
with HBr (48%) is used for preparing alkyl bromide. Good yields of
R—I may be obtained by heating alcohols with sodium or potassium
iodide in 95% orthophosphoric acid. The order of reactivity of alcohols
with a given haloacid is 3°>2°>1°. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide
are usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the
reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively.

The preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing
dry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating
a mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid.

The above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl
halides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double
bond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single
bond.

The ortho and para isomers can be easily separated due to large
difference in their melting points. Reactions with iodine are reversible
in nature and require the presence of an oxidising agent (HNO3,

are not prepared by this method due to high reactivity of fluorine.

Melting and boiling points

Methyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride and some
chlorofluoromethanes are gases at room temperature. Higher members
are liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic
halogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well
as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the
intermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals)
are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points
of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those
of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass.

The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and
have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different
halides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling
points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCIl> RF. This
is because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the
magnitude of van der Waal forces increases.

Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same.
However, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their ortho-
and meta-isomers. It is due to symmetry of para-isomers that fits in
crystal lattice better as compared to ortho- and meta-isomers.

Density

Bromo, iodo and polychloro derivatives of hydrocarbons are heavier than
water. The density increases with increase in number of carbon atoms,
halogen atoms and atomic mass of the halogen atoms (Table 6.3).

Solubility

The haloalkanes are very slightly soluble in water. In order to dissolve
haloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between
the haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water
molecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between
the haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the
original hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes
in water is low. However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents
because the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and
solvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken
in the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules.

already existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic
substitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions.
In this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the
substrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded
to halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,
called leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution
reaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic
substitution reaction.

Mechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different
mechanims which are described below:

single step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses
and the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon
atom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving
group weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds
of the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In
transition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the
attacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the
carbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon,
C-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking
nucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon.
As a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of
carbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an
umbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This
process is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition
state, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming
nucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are
unstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon
is simultaneously bonded to five atoms.

Spacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration.

Since this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the
carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents
on or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the
simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in S,2 reactions
because there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides
are the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching

Syl reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents

Step I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C-Br bond breaking for which the
energy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since
the rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the
concentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater
the stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster
will be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 3° alkyl halides undergo Sy1 reaction
very fast because of the high stability of 3° carbocations. We can sum up the order of reactivity
of alkyl halides towards Sy1 and Sy2 reactions as follows:

For S,2 reaction

Tertiary halide; Secondary halide; Primary halide; CH,X

For S,1 reaction

For the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the Sy1
reaction. The carbocation thus formed gets stabilised through resonance (Unit 8, Class XI) as

Of the two primary bromides, the carbocation intermediate derived from

of greater electron donating inductive effect of (CH3),CH- group. Therefore,
(CH,),CHCH,Br is more reactive than CH;CH,CH.CH,Br in Sy1 reactions.
CH;CH,CH(Br)CH3; is a secondary bromide and (CH,),CBr is a tertiary

Of the two secondary bromides, the carbocation intermediate obtained
from C,H,CH(C,H,)Br is more stable than obtained from C,H,CH(CH,)Br
because it is stabilised by two phenyl groups due to resonance. Therefore,
the former bromide is more reactive than the latter in S.1 reactions. A
phenyl group is bulkier than a methyl group. Therefore, C,H,CH(C,H,)Br
is less reactive than C,H,CH(CH,)Br in S,2 reactions.

(c) Stereochemical aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions
In order to understand the stereochemical aspects of substitution
reactions, we need to learn some basic stereochemical principles
and notations (optical activity, chirality, retention, inversion,
racemisation, etc.).

(i) Optical activity: Plane of plane polarised light produced by
passing ordinary light through Nicol prism is rotated when it
is passed through the solutions of certain compounds. Such
compounds are called optically active compounds. The angle

William Nicol (1768- by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an
1851) developed the first instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane
prism that produced of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it
plane polarised light.

is called dextrorotatory (Greek for right rotating) or the d-form
and is indicated by placing a positive (+) sign before the degree
of rotation. If the light is rotated towards left (anticlockwise
direction), the compound is said to be laevo-rotatory or the
Lform and a negative (-) sign is placed before the degree of
rotation. Such (+) and (-) isomers of a compound are called
optical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical
isomerism.

(ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The
observation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain
compounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the
foundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that
aqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical
rotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration)
but opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in
optical activity was associated with the three dimensional
arrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of

two types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van’t Hoff and French
scientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently
argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies)
around a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents
attached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the
molecule is not superimposed (overlapped) on the molecule;
such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre.
The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to
as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along
with non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for
the optical activity in such organic compounds.

symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day
objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to
their mirror images and can be superimposed.
However, many objects are non superimposable on
their mirror images. For example, your left and right
hand look similar but if you put your left hand on
your right hand by moving them in the same plane,
they do not coincide. The objects which are non-
superimposable on their mirror image (like a pair
of hands) are said to be chiral and this property is
known as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically
active, while the objects, which are, superimposable
on their mirror images are called achiral. These
molecules are optically inactive.

The above test of molecular chirality can be
applied to organic molecules by constructing
models and its mirror images or by drawing three
dimensional structures and attempting to
superimpose them in our minds. There are other
aids, however, that can assist us in recognising

Fig 6.4: Some common examples of chiral and chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of

a single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider
two simple molecules propan-2-ol (Fig.6.5) and butan-2-ol (Fig.6.6)
and their mirror images.

carbon,

as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not

different. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure

completely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule.

Fig. 6.7: A chiral molecule The stereoisomers related to each other as non-

and its mirrorimage Superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers
(Fig. 6.7). A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are
enantiomers.

Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely,
melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ
with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the
enantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory.

However, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to
the absolute (actual) configuration of the molecule.

A mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions
will have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer
will be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such
a mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic
modification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl
or (+) before the name, for example (+) butan-2-ol. The process
of conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as
racemisation.

Retention: Retention of configuration is the preservation of the spatial
arrangement of bonds to an asymmetric centre during a chemical
reaction or transformation.

In general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken,
the product will have the same general configuration of groups
around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said
to proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an
example, the reaction that takes place when (—)-2-methylbutan- 1-ol
is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.

(iv)

It is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in
the reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation
has changed in the product. This is so because two different
compounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have
different optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of
optical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of
optical rotation).

Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes
for a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly
linked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the
replacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction;

If (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention
of configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A.

If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion
of configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B.

Reprint 2025-26

If a 50:50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called

racemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will

rotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another.

Now let us have a fresh look at S,1 and S,2 mechanisms by
taking examples of optically active alkyl halides.

In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a
result of Sy2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared
to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the
side opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When
(-)-2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,
(+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the -OH group occupying the position
opposite to what bromide had occupied.

Thus, S,2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by
inversion of configuration.

In case of optically active alkyl halides, Syl reactions are
accompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it
happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp”
hybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be
accomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in

As a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since B-hydrogen
atom is involved in elimination, it is often called B-elimination.

If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to
the availability of more than one B-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene
is formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first
observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as
Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as
“in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that
alkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the
doubly bonded carbon atoms.” Thus, 2-bromopentane gives
pent-2-ene as the major product.

Elimination versus substitution

A chemical reaction is the result of competition; it is a race that is won by the fastest
runner. A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An
alkyl halide with B-hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two
competing routes: substitution (S,1 and S,2) and elimination. Which route will be taken
up depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and
reaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts
a proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa.
Similarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a S,2 reaction, a secondary halide- S,2 or
elimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- S.1 or
elimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene.

3. Reaction with metals

Most organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain
metals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such
compounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An
important class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor
Grignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgxX, referred as
Grignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of
haloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether.

Victor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he
took a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was
not to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic
chemistry. While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process
of methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this
purpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be
successful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard
used this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained
a professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded
the Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who
had made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation.

In the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent
but highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive
magnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic.

Grignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of
proton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently
acidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons.

RMgxX + H,OQ —————> RH + Mg(OH)X
It is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard
reagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other

hand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting
halides to hydrocarbons.

Wurtz reaction

Alkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons
containing double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide.
This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction.

1. Nucleophilic substitution
Aryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic
substitution reactions due to the following reasons:
(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen
atom are in conjugation with z-electrons of the ring and the
following resonating structures are possible.

ea ®o me! ®o
w) C

C—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to
resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult
than haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards
nucleophilic substitution reaction.

The sp? hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more
electronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond
more tightly than sp®-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with
less s-chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is
177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to
break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes
are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic
substitution reaction.

Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl
cation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised
by resonance and therefore, S,1 mechanism is ruled out.
Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron
rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.

Can you think why does NO, group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions
and not at meta- position?

As shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the
electron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile
on haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative
charge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is
stabilised by -NO, group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating
structures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the -NO, group. Therefore,
the presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and
no effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of -NO, group at meta-position.

2. Electrophilic substitution reactions

Haloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene
ring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts
reactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is 0, p-
directing; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and para-
positions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p-directing influence
of halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating
structures of halobenzene as shown:

.. (S) ® ®

I

Due to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and
para-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom
because of its -I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from
the benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as
compared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions
in haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as
compared to those in benzene.

0.9 Although chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho-,

Resonance effect stabilises the

intermediate carbocation
Through resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and
the effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The
inductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron
withdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect
tends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and para-
positions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and para-
attack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect
and orientation is controlled by resonance effect.

Comp ounds useful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are
described in this section.

6.8.1 Dichloro- Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a
methane propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of
(Methylene drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene
chloride) chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower

levels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing
and vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness,
nausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct
skin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild
redness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea.

6.8.2 Trichloro- Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,
methane iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in

(Chloroform) the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a
general anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,
safer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as
an anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central
nervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million
parts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness,
fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage
to the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the
kidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in
chloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of
light to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as
phosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles
completely filled so that air is kept out.

methane due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due

1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry,
as a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire
extinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon
tetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects
are dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause
permanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead
rapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl,
can make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate

most common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from
tetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced
for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By
1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds
annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes
its way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the
stratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain
reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance.

DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared
in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy
Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as
an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine
and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased
enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because
of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice
that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT
began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed
resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity
towards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility
compounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by
animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If
ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal
over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973,
although it is still in use in some other parts of the world.

Alkyl/ Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-, tetra-, etc.)
compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in
their structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbon-
halogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive
charge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge.

Alkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition
of halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of -OH group of alcohols with halogens using

phosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by
electrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen
exchange method.

The boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the
corresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces
of attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic
solvents.

The polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their
nucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form
organometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into
S,1 and S,2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in
understanding the reaction mechanisms of S,1 and S,2 reactions. S,2 reactions of
chiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while S,1 reactions
are characterised by racemisation.

A number of polyhalogen compounds e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform,
carbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications. However,
some of these compounds cannot be easily decomposed and even cause depletion of
ozone layer and are proving environmental hazards.
