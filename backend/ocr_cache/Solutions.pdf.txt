Almost all processes in body occur in some kind of liquid solutions.

In normal life we rarely come across pure substances.
Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure
substances. Their utility or importance in life depends
on their composition. For example, the properties of
brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different
from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc
and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin);
1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water
prevents tooth decay, while 1.5 ppm causes the tooth
to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride
ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is
used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always
dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic
concentrations that match with blood plasma
concentrations and so on.

In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid
solutions and their formation. This will be followed by
studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour
pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with
types of solutions and then various alternatives in
which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in
liquid solution.

Il ‘Types of Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two
Solutions components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition
and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the

component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent.

Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or

more components present in the solution other than solvent are called

solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,

consisting of two components). Here each component may be
solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.

Oxygen dissolved in water
Ethanol dissolved in water

Glucose dissolved in water

Solution of hydrogen in palladium

Copper dissolved in gold

Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its
concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively
or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the
solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute)
or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of
solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to
lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description
of the solution.

There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration

of the solution quantitatively.

i)

(ii)

Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a
solution is defined as:

Mass % of a component

_ Mass of the component in the solution x 100 (1.1)
Total mass of the solution ,

For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by
mass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water
resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass
percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications.
For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass
percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.

Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as:
Volume of the component

Volume % of a component = x 100

Total volume of solution
(1.2)

Reprint 2025-26

For example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL
of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of
the solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly
expressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of
ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the
engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing
point of water to 255.4K (-17.6°C).

(iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is
commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by
volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in
100 mL of the solution.

(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it
is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm)
and is defined as:

Parts per million =

Number of parts of the component

Total number of parts of all components of the solution

As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can
also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to
volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about
6 x 10° g of dissolved oxygen (O,). Such a small concentration is
also expressed as 5.8 g per 10° g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The
concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed
in terms of pg mL” or ppm.

Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and
subscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component.
It is defined as:

Mole fraction of a component =

—

(v

Number of moles of the component
Total number of moles of all the components

For example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are
m and n, respectively, the mole fraction of A will be

Each method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its
own merits and demerits. Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality
are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of
temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature
and the mass does not.

1.3 Solubility Solubility of a substance is its maximum amount that can be dissolved
in a specified amount of solvent at a specified temperature. It depends
upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and
pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid
or a gas in a liquid.

Chemistry peGuu

Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride
and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do
not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in
benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that
polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-
polar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the
intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like
dissolves like.

When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves
and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as
dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute
particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as
crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the
same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going
into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and
a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.

Solute + Solvent = Solution (1.10)

At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain
constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.
Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.
Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same
temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An
unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at
the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium
with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the
maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.

Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into
another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these
variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also
control this phenomenon.

Effect of temperature

The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature
changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,
being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In
general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is
endothermic (A,,., H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in
temperature and if it is exothermic (A,,., H <0) the solubility should
decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.

Effect of pressure

Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in
liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible
and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.

Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent
in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On
the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water.
Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and

Reprint 2025-26

temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.
For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in
Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous
system at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in
a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of
gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.
Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the
gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of
gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate
at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to
enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium
is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the
solution and thus its solubility increases.

Henry was the first to give a
quantitative relation between
pressure and solubility of a gas in
a solvent which is known as
Henry’s law. The law states that
at a constant temperature, the
solubility of a gas in a liquid is
directly proportional to the
partial pressure of the gas

pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in
the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be
said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is
1000 proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over
the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s
law states that “the partial pressure of the gas in
vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction

of the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:

500 p= Ky x (1.11)

aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in
warm waters.

If N, gas is bubbled through water at 293 K, how many millimoles of N,
gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that N, exerts a partial
pressure of 0.987 bar. Given that Henry’s law constant for N, at 293 Kis

The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution.

The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying

Henry’s law. Thus:

p (nitrogen) _ 0.987bar
Ky 76,480 bar

As 1 litre of water contains 55.5 mol of it, therefore if n represents

n mol n
x (Nitrogen) = nmol+55.5mol 55.5

_ 7.16x10* mol x 1000 mmol

1 mol

=1,.29x10°

Henry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some
biological phenomena. Notable among these are:

e To increase the solubility of CO, in soft drinks and soda water, the
bottle is sealed under high pressure.

e Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases
while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure
increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the
divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This
releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles
of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical
condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life.

Reprint 2025-26

To avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations
of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled
with air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and

32.1% oxygen).

e At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at
the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the
blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low
blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think

clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.

Effect of Temperature

Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When
dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process
of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat
is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that
dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must

follow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is

an exothermic

process, the solubility should decrease with increase of

temperature.

the solubility of H,S in water at STP is 0.195 m, calculate Henry’s law constant.

Liquid solutions are formed when solvent is a liquid. The solute can be
a gas, a liquid or a solid. Solutions of gases in liquids have already
been discussed in Section 1.3.2. In this Section, we shall discuss the
solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain
one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile.
The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties
of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two
components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (ii) solids

in liquids.

Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the
two components as 1 and 2. When taken in a closed vessel, both the
components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be
established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total
vapour pressure at this stage be p,,,,, and p, and p, be the partial
vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These
partial pressures are related to the mole fractions x, and x, of the two

components 1 and 2 respectively.

The French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the
quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as
the Raoult’s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids,

Following conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16).

(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the
mole fraction of component 2.

(iii) Depending on the vapour pressures

total vapour pressure over the

(a)

According to Raoult’s law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component
in a given solution is given by p, = x P.. In the solution of a gas ina
liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and
we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry’s law which
states that

p= K,x.
If we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it
can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas
is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the

proportionality constant K,, differs from p,°. Thus, Raoult’s law becomes
a special case of Henry’s law in which K, becomes equal to p,°.

Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in
liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in
water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some
physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of
pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given
temperature vapourise and under
equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted
by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid
phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].
In a pure liquid the entire surface is
occupied by the molecules of the liquid. Ifa

reduced. Consequently, the number of
solvent molecules escaping from the surface
is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour
pressure is also reduced.

The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the
quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of
its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by
adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that
produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at
the same temperature.

Raoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution
the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the
solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.

In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by
2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are
present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p, be

1.5 Ideal and Vlon- Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal
ideal Solutions solutions on the basis of Raoult’s law.

1.5.1 Ideal The solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
Solutions concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have
two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the
pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume
of mixing is also zero, i.e.,
Amid = O, AnxV = O (1.21)

It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components
are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of
volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of
the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and
B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will
be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition
to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.
If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are
nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal
solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly
ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane
and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.

1.5.2 Non-ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
Solutions concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure
of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by
Raoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive
deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s
law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions
for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.

The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the
molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B
interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case
the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules
are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent
molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will
find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour

pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone
behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded.
On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and
break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of
interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law
[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to
acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are
weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and
solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.

In case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular
attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between
A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative
deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.
In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic
proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the
respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar
molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone
forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.
This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen
bond with acetone molecule as shown.

This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each
component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting
in negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].

Some liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures
having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at
a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the
components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes
called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling
azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from
Raoult’s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.

Reprint 2025-26

For example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars)
on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95%
by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope
composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same
composition, and no further separation occurs.

The solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law
form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid
and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has
the approximate composition, 68% nitric acid and 32% water by mass,
with a boiling point of 393.5 K.

1.0 Colligative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of solution
. decreases when a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile solvent.
Droperties and There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this
Determination decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent
of Molar Mass (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of
the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute
particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number
of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called
colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare
means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these

properties one by one.

1.6.1 Relative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in
Lowering of solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the
Vapour lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the
Pressure solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20)

given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of
the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e.,

Here w, and W, are the masses and M, and M, are the molar masses
of the solvent and solute respectively.

From this equation (1.28), knowing all other quantities, the molar
mass of solute (M,) can be calculated.

Example 1.0. The vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0.850
bar. A non-volatile, non-electrolyte solid weighing 0.5 g when added to
39.0 g of benzene (molar mass 78 g mol’). Vapour pressure of the solution,
then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance?

Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows:
p,° = 0.850 bar; p= 0.845 bar; M, = 78g mol'; w,=0.5g; w,=39g
Substituting these values in equation (2.28), we get

0.850 bar- 0.845 bar _ 0.5 g x 78 g mol

0.850 bar 7 M, x 398

Therefore, M, = 170 g mol '

The vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of
temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure
is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at
373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure
of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last
section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence
of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure
of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For
example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is
less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution
boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by
raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of
the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is

Since water boils at 373.15 K at 1.013 bar pressure, therefore, the

The boiling point of benzene is 353.23 K. When 1.80 g of a non-volatile

The elevation (AT,) in the boiling point = 354.11 K- 353. 23 K = 0.88 K

1.6.3 Depression The lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the

that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic
equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the
freezing point of a substance may be defined as
the temperature at which the vapour pressure of
the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its
vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution
will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the
vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is

If w, gram of the solute having molar mass as M,, present in w,

There are many phenomena which we observe in nature or at home.
For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine (salt water);
wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse
when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we
find one thing common in all,
that is, all these substances
are bound by membranes.

molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of
bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind
of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM).

Assume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-
permeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent
and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through
the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow
of the solvent is called osmosis.

The flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the
solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane
can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This
pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic
pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to
the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to
osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules
always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.
The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration
of the solution.

The osmotic pressure of a solution is the
excess pressure that must be applied to a
solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the
passage of solvent molecules through a
semipermeable membrane into the solution. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a
colligative property as it depends on the number
of solute molecules and not on their identity.
For dilute solutions, it has been found
experimentally that osmotic pressure is
proportional to the molarity, C of the
solution at a given temperature T. Thus:

Il=CRT (1.39)
Here Il is the osmotic pressure and R is the
gas constant.
Il = (n, /V) RT (1.40)
Here V is volume of a solution in litres containing n, moles of solute.

If w, grams of solute, of molar mass, M, is present in the solution, then
n, = Ww, / M, and we can write,

Measurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of
determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to
determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other

macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over
other methods as pressure measurement is around the room
temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.
As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large
even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for
determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for
biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures
and polymers have poor solubility.

Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given
temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions
are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs
between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated
with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of
0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline
solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if
we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/
volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they
would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt
concentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said
to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed
in this solution and they would swell.

Example Il! 200 cm® of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of the
protein. The osmotic pressure of such a solution at 300 K is found to

The phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be
explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated
salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted
flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become
limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the
water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through
osmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/
volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis.
People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in
tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting

Reprint 2025-26

puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into
plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly
due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by
adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process
of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water,
shrivels and dies.

is 74.5 g and the mass of one mole of KCl would be 37.25 g. This
brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into
ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than
the true value.

case of association, value of iis less than unity while for dissociation it
is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl
solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is
nearly 0.5.

2 g of benzoic acid (C,H,;COOH) dissolved in 25 g of benzene shows a Example 1.12
depression in freezing point equal to 1.62 K. Molal depression constant

for benzene is 4.9 K kg mol '. What is the percentage association of acid

if it forms dimer in solution?

The given quantities are: w, = 2 g; K,= 4.9 Kkg mol’; w, = 25g, Solution
AT, = 1.62 K

Substituting these values in equation (1.36) we get:

4.9 Kkg mol x2 gx 1000 g kg”
27 25 gx 1.62K
Thus, experimental molar mass of benzoic acid in benzene is
= 241.98 g mol!
Now consider the following equilibrium for the acid:

2C,H,COOH = (C,H,COOH),

= 241.98 g mol!

If x represents the degree of association of the solute then we would
have (1 - x) mol of benzoic acid left in unassociated form and

x
correspondingly 3 as associated moles of benzoic acid at equilibrium.
Therefore, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium is:

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Solutions are
classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is
expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The
dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law, according to which, at a
given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to
the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by
the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative
lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole
fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary
liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another
form of Raoult’s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult’s law is stated

as: Piotal = P)xX + DSXy . Solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range
of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult’s
law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to
very large deviations from Raoult’s law.

The properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and
are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These
are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing
point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure
higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties
have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in
solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which
associate show higher molar mass than their actual values.

Quantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be
expressed by van’t Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal
molar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed
colligative property to the calculated colligative property.
