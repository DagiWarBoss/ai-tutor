4.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices
and algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system
of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of
matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like

a,x+b, y=c,

a,x+b,y=e,
a 5b c

can be represented as ! 1 a -| a Now, this
a, by \Ly Cy

system of equations has a unique solution or not, is
determined by the number a, b, — a, b,. (Recall that if

or, a, b, — a,b, #0, then the system of linear

and is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in
Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc.

In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries.
Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications
of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix,
consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear
equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix.

4.2 Determinant

To every square matrix A = [a,] of order n, we can associate a number (real or
complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where a, = (i, J)" element of A.

This may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a
unique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of
numbers (real or complex) and f: M > K is defined by f(A) = k, where A € M and
k € K, then f(A) is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by | A| or det A or A.

IfA= A , then determinant of A is written as | A| = | cd | = det (A)

Remarks

(i) For matrix A, | A| is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A.
(ii) Only square matrices have determinants.

4.2.3 Determinant of a matrix of order 3 x 3

Determinant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of
second order determinants. This is known as expansion of a determinant along
a row (or a column). There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order

reader to verify that the values of |A| by expanding along R,, C, and C, are equal to the
value of | A| obtained in (1), (2) or (3).

Hence, expanding a determinant along any row or column gives same value.
Remarks

(i) For easier calculations, we shall expand the determinant along that row or column
which contains maximum number of zeros.

(ii) While expanding, instead of multiplying by (—1)'*’, we can multiply by +1 or—1
according as (i + j) is even or odd.

4.3 Area of a Triangle

In earlier classes, we have studied that the area of a triangle whose vertices are

(x,, ¥,), (x, ¥,) and (x,, Vy), is given by the expression 5 [x,(v,-7,) + x, Wy) +

x, (v,-,)]. Now this expression can be written in the form of a determinant as

| y, 1

= —|x 1

A 5|% . (1)

Remarks
(i) Since area is a positive quantity, we always take the absolute value of the
determinant in (1).

(ii) If area is given, use both positive and negative values of the determinant for
calculation.

(iit) The area of the triangle formed by three collinear points is zero.
Example 6 Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are (3, 8), (— 4, 2) and (5, 1).

4.4 Minors and Cofactors

In this section, we will learn to write the expansion of a determinant in compact form
using minors and cofactors.

Definition 1 Minor of an element a, of a determinant is the determinant obtained by
deleting its ith row and jth column in which element a, lies. Minor of an element a, is
denoted by M,,.

Remark Minor of an element of a determinant of order n(n = 2) is a determinant of
order n — 1.

Definition 2 Cofactor of an element Aj; denoted by A; is defined by
A, = (-l)'*/ M,, where M, is minor of a,

Example 9 Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant 4

Solution Minor of the element a is M,
Here a,, = 1. So M,, = Minor of a, = 3
M,,= Minor of the element a,, = 4
M,, = Minor of the element a,, = —2

Theorem 4 A square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix.
Proof Let A be invertible matrix of order n and I be the identity matrix of order n.
Then, there exists a square matrix B of order n such that AB = BA =I

Now AB=I. So |AB| =|I| or |A| |B] =1 (since |I|=1,

AB|=|A||B)
This gives |A| # 0. Hence A is nonsingular.

4.6 Applications of Determinants and Matrices

In this section, we shall discuss application of determinants and matrices for solving the
system of linear equations in two or three variables and for checking the consistency of
the system of linear equations.

Consistent system A system of equations is said to be consistent if its solution (one
or more) exists.

Inconsistent system A system of equations is said to be inconsistent if its solution
does not exist.

‘= Note |In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations

having unique solutions only.

4.6.1 Solution of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix
Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using
inverse of the coefficient matrix.

Consider the system of equations

a,xtbyt+ez= d,

a,x+b,y+ce,z=d

2

a,x+b,y+c,z=d,
a bh G x d,
Let A=|a 6, c,|, X=} y| and B=| d,
a, b, c, 4 d,
Then, the system of equations can be written as, AX = B, 1.e.,
a 5b G|\x d,
a, by | |v) =|4,
a, b; c,| |z d,

Case | If Ais a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists. Now

AX=B
or AT (AX)=A'B (premultiplying by A‘)
or (A'A) X=A'B (by associative property)
or IX=A'B
or X=A'B

This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as
inverse of a matrix is unique. This method of solving system of equations is known as
Matrix Method.

Case |) If A is a singular matrix, then | A| = 0.
In this case, we calculate (adj A) B.

If (adj A) B # O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the
system of equations is called inconsistent.

Reprint 2025-26

DETERMINANTS 95

If (adj A) B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according
as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution.

Example 16 Solve the system of equations
2x + 5y=1
3x+2y=7

Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where

Now, Al =-—11 +0, Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution.

Hence x=3,y=-1
Example 17 Solve the following system of equations by matrix method.
3x—2y+3z=8
2x+y—-z=1
4x —3y+ 2z7=4
Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where
3 2 3 x 8
A=/2 1 -l|,X=|yj]and B=/1
4 3 2 Zz 4

We see that
|A| =3 (2-3) + 2(4+ 4) +3 (6-4) =- 1740

Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists. Now

Hence x=1,y=2andz=3.

Example 18 The sum of three numbers is 6. If we multiply third number by 3 and add
second number to it, we get 11. By adding first and third numbers, we get double of the
second number. Represent it algebraically and find the numbers using matrix method.

Solution Let first, second and third numbers be denoted by x, y and z, respectively.
Then, according to given conditions, we have

xty+z=6
yt+3z=11
x+z=2y orx—2y+z=0

This system can be written as A X = B, where

1 1 1 x 6
A= 0 1 3 ,X= y andB= 11

Here |A| = 1(1+6)—(0- 3)+(0-1) =9 T 0. Now we find adj A

Historical Note

The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of
several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the
discovery of simple method of elimination. The arrangement of rods was precisely
that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the
idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant
Mikami, China, pp 30, 93.

Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth
century in his work ‘Kai Fukudai no Ho’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of
determinants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a
quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous
linear equations. T. Hayashi, “The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese
Mathematics,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V.

Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.
He may be called the formal founder. Laplace (1772), gave general method of
expanding a determinant in terms ofits complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange
treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose
other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his
theory of numbers.

The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who
stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-
rows, which for the special case of m =n reduces to the multiplication theorem.

Also on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He
used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication
theorem more satisfactory than Binet’s.

The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after
this the word determinant received its final acceptance.
