3.1 Introduction

The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices
are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies
our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The
evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and
simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a
representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices
far exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet
programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business
and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an
experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and
reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices
are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches
of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial
management.

In this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the
fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra.

Suppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may
express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of
notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks
and 6 pens. We may express it as [15 6] with the understanding that first number
inside [ | is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed
by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession

of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which

is as follows:

Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens,
Fauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens,
Simran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens.
Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows:
Notebooks Pens
Radha 15 6

In the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of

note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the

respectively. Similarly, in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent
the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The
entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia
and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a
matrix. Formally, we define matrix as:

Definition 1 A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The
numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.

We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:

; 1
x
A=| 0 V5], B=| 3.5 -1 2 |, C= *
5 cosx sinx+2 tanx
3 6 3 5 =

In the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows
of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the
matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2
rows and 3 columns.

3.2.1 Order of a matrix

A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m x n or simply m x n
matrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we
have Aas 3 x 2 matrix, B as 3 x 3 matrix and C as 2 x 3 matrix. We observe that A has
3 x 2 =6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively.

In general, an m x n matrix has the following rectangular array:

a), A Ajz ++ Ay; vee A),
a, Ay a, eee a, vee a,
a, a, as vee a, vee a,

eee .
ml m2 m3 mp mn

or A=[a,] I<i<m,1lsj<n ijeN

Thus the 7 row consists of the elements a,,, @,,, 4,5... @,,, While the j column
consists of the elements Ayjp Agjy Aspens A

mx n?

mj?

In general a,» is an element lying in the 7 row and _j® column. We can also call
it as the (i, j)" element of A. The number of elements in an m x n matrix will be
equal to mn.

In this chapter

1. Weshall follow the notation, namely A= [4], tO indicate that A is a matrix

m Xn

of order m x n.

2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or
functions taking real values.

We can also represent any point (x, vy) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as

x
Hl (or [x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as

P aH or [0 1].

Observe that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear
figure in the form ofa matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices
A (1, 0), B (3, 2), C C1, 3), D C1, 2).

Now, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as

ABC 1

Thus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in
a plane.

The entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women
workers in factory HI.

Example 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?

Solution We know that if a matrix is of order m x n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find
all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural
numbers, whose product is 8.

Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)

Hence, possible orders are 1 x 8, 8 x1,4.x 2,2 x 4

3.4 Operations on Matrices

In this section, we shall introduce certain operations on matrices, namely, addition of
matrices, multiplication of a matrix by a scalar, difference and multiplication of matrices.

3.4.1 Addition of matrices

Suppose Fatima has two factories at places A and B. Each factory produces sport
shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The
quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below:

2) 75 65 2} 70 55

Suppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price
category. Then the total production

In category 1 : for boys (80 + 90), for girls (60 + 50)
In category 2 : for boys (75 + 70), for girls (65 + 55)

In category 3 : for boys (90 + 75), for girls (85 + 75)

80 +90 60 +50

by multiplying each element of A by the scalar k.

Now A+B= [a,] [b,,] = [a,, bi]

(ii) Associative Law For any three matrices A = [a,], B= [b,], C= [¢,] of the

(iv) The existence of additive inverse Let A = [4,1 ., be any matrix, then we
have another matrix as — A = [— din ., Such that A + (— A) = (—A) + A= O. So

How much money does each need to spend? Clearly, Meera needs % (5 x 2 + 50 x 5)
that is 260, while Nadeem needs (8 x 5 + 50 x 10) , that is 540. In terms of matrix
representation, we can write the above information as follows:

Requirements Prices per piece (in Rupees) Money needed (in Rupees)

2 5 5 5x2+5x50|_ | 260
8 10 50 8x5+10x50} | 540
Suppose that they enquire about the rates from another shop, quoted as follows:

pen —%4 each, story book — % 40 each.

Now, the money required by Meera and Nadeem to make purchases will be
respectively %(4 x 2 + 40 x 5) = %208 and %(8 x 4+ 10 x 40) =% 432

The above is an example of multiplication of matrices. We observe that, for
multiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to
the number of rows in B. Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix,

we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum.
Formally, we define multiplication of matrices as follows:

The product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is
equal to the number of rows of B. Let A= [a,] be an m x n matrix and B = [5,] be an
n X p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m  p.
To get the (i, k)"" element c,, of the matrix C, we take the /* row of A and k" column
of B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words,
ifA= [4]... B= [b,] then the 7" row of A is [a,, a,, ... a,,] and the k" column of

Remark Tf AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is
defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3)
rows. If A, B are, respectively m x n, k x / matrices, then both AB and BA are defined
if and only if 7 =k and / =m. In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the
same order, then both AB and BA are defined.

Non-commutativity of multiplication of matrices

Now, we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not
necessary that AB = BA.

Solution Since A is a 2 x 3 matrix and B is 3 x 2 matrix. Hence AB and BA are both
defined and are matrices of order 2 x 2 and3 x 3, respectively. Note that

Clearly AB # BA

In the above example both AB and BA are of different order and so AB # BA. But
one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same
order. But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of
same order they may not be same.

Zero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices

not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example.

3.4.6 Properties of multiplication of matrices

The multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without
proof.

1. The associative law For any three matrices A, B and C. We have
(AB) C =A (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined.
2. The distributive law For three matrices A, B and C.
(i) A(B+C) = AB +AC
(ii) (A+B) C = AC + BC, whenever both sides of equality are defined.

3. The existence of multiplicative identity For every square matrix A, there
exist an identity matrix of same order such that IA = AI = A.

Now, we shall verify these properties by examples.

Theorem I For any square matrix A with real number entries, A + A‘ is a symmetric
matrix and A— A’ is a skew symmetric matrix.
Proof Let B=A+A’, then

B’= (A+A’)

C= (A-A’)’=A'-(AY (Why?)

Therefore C= A-A’ is askew symmetric matrix.

3.7 Invertible Matrices

Definition 6 If A is a square matrix of order m, and if there exists another square
matrix B of the same order m, such that AB = BA = I, then B 1s called the inverse
matrix of A and it is denoted by A“ '. In that case A is said to be invertible.

1. A rectangular matrix does not possess inverse matrix, since for products BA

and AB to be defined and to be equal, it is necessary that matrices A and B
should be square matrices of the same order.

. If B is the inverse of A, then A is also the inverse of B.

Theorem 3 (Uniqueness of inverse) Inverse of a square matrix, if it exists, is unique.

Proot Let A = [a,] be a square matrix of order m. If possible, let B and C be two
inverses of A. We shall show that B = C.

Since B is the inverse of A

AB=BA=I .. (1)
Since C is also the inverse of A
AC =CA=I w. (2)
Thus B=BI=B (AC) = (BA) C=IC=C

Theorem 4 If A and B are invertible matrices of the same order, then (AB)! = B? At.

Proot From the definition of inverse of a matrix, we have

(AB) (AB)! = 1
or A! (AB) (AB)! =A (Pre multiplying both sides by A“!)
or (A'A) B (AB)! =A (Since A! I = A)
or IB (AB)! =A!
or B (AB)! =A"!
or B! B (AB)! =B' A!
or I (AB)! =B? A!
Hence (AB)! =B! A!

Let AB be symmetric, then (AB)’ = AB
But (AB) = B’A’= BA (Why?)
Therefore BA = AB
Conversely, if AB = BA, then we shall show that AB is symmetric.
Now (AB)' =B'A’

Hence AB is symmetric.
