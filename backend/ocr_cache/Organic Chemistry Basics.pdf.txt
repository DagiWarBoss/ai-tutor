In the previous unit you have learnt that the element
carbon has the unique property called catenation due to
which it forms covalent bonds with other carbon atoms.
It also forms covalent bonds with atoms of other elements
like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus
and halogens. The resulting compounds are studied
under a separate branch of chemistry called organic
chemistry. This unit incorporates some basic principles
and techniques of analysis required for understanding the
formation and properties of organic compounds.

8.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

Organic compounds are vital for sustaining life on earth
and include complex molecules like genetic information
bearing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins that
constitute essential compounds of our blood, muscles and
skin. Organic compounds appear in materials like clothing,
fuels, polymers, dyes and medicines. These are some of
the important areas of application of these compounds.

Science of organic chemistry is about two hundred
years old. Around the year 1780, chemists began to
distinguish between organic compounds obtained from
plants and animals and inorganic compounds prepared
from mineral sources. Berzilius, a Swedish chemist
proposed that a ‘vital force’ was responsible for the
formation of organic compounds. However, this notion
was rejected in 1828 when F. Wohler synthesised an
organic compound, urea from an inorganic compound,
ammonium cyanate.

NH,CNO. —*#_» NH,CONH,
Ammonium cyanate Urea

The pioneering synthesis of acetic acid by Kolbe
(1845) and that of methane by Berthelot (1856) showed
conclusively that organic compounds could be synthesised
from inorganic sources in a laboratory.

The development of electronic theory of
covalent bonding ushered organic chemistry
into its modern shape.

8.2 TETRAVALENCE OF CARBON:
SHAPES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

8.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds

The knowledge of fundamental concepts of
molecular structure helps in understanding
and predicting the properties of organic
compounds. You have already learnt theories
of valency and molecular structure in Unit 4.
Also, you already know that tetravalence of
carbon and the formation of covalent bonds
by it are explained in terms of its electronic
configuration and the hybridisation of s and p
orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and
the shapes of molecules like methane (CH,),
ethene (C,H,), ethyne (C,H,) are explained
in terms of the use of sp°, sp? and sp hybrid
orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective
molecules.

Hybridisation influences the bond length
and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds.
The sp hybrid orbital contains more s
character and hence it is closer to its nucleus
and forms shorter and stronger bonds than
the sp* hybrid orbital. The sp? hybrid orbital
is intermediate in s character between sp
and sp? and, hence, the length and enthalpy
of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate
between them. The change in hybridisation
affects the electronegativity of carbon. The
greater the s character of the hybrid orbitals,
the greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a
carbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with
50% s character is more electronegative than
that possessing sp’ or sp* hybridised orbitals.
This relative electronegativity is reflected in
several physical and chemical properties of
the molecules concerned, about which you
will learn in later units.

8.2.2. Some Characteristic Features of 7

Bonds
In ax (pi) bond formation, parallel orientation
of the two p orbitals on adjacent atoms is
necessary for a proper sideways overlap.

Thus, in H,C=CH, molecule all the atoms
must be in the same plane. The p orbitals are
mutually parallel and both the p orbitals are
perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.
Rotation of one CH, fragment with respect
to other interferes with maximum overlap
of p orbitals and, therefore, such rotation
about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is
restricted. The electron charge cloud of the
bond is located above and below the plane of
bonding atoms. This results in the electrons
being easily available to the attacking
reagents. In general, m bonds provide the most
reactive centres in the molecules containing
multiple bonds.

8.3. STRUCTURAL REPRESENTATIONS
OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

8.3.1 Complete, Condensed and Bond-line
Structural Formulas

Structures of organic compounds are
represented in several ways. The Lewis
structure or dot structure, dash structure,
condensed structure and bond line structural
formulas are some of the specific types. The
Lewis structures, however, can be simplified
by representing the two-electron covalent
bond by a dash (-). Such a structural formula
focuses on the electrons involved in bond
formation. A single dash represents a single
bond, double dash is used for double bond
and a triple dash represents triple bond. Lone-
pairs of electrons on heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen,
nitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may
not be shown. Thus, ethane (C,H,), ethene
(C,H,), ethyne (C,H,) and methanol (CH,OH)
can be represented by the following structural
formulas. Such structural representations are
called complete structural formulas.

H H

| | HOUR
H H H H
Ethane Ethene
H H

|. |
H—-C=C-H H—C— 0-H or H= C—O-H

H H

Ethyne Methanol

These structural formulas can be further
abbreviated by omitting some or all of the
dashes representing covalent bonds and by
indicating the number of identical groups
attached to an atom by a subscript. The
resulting expression of the compound is
called a condensed structural formula. Thus,
ethane, ethene, ethyne and methanol can be
written as:

CH,CH,
Ethane

HC=CH
Ethyne

H,C=CH,
Ethene

CH,OH
Methanol

CHEMISTRY

Similarly, CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,
can be further condensed to CH,(CH,),CH,.
For further simplification, organic chemists
use another way of representing the
structures, in which only lines are used.
In this bond-line structural representation
of organic compounds, carbon and
hydrogen atoms are not shown and the
lines representing carbon-carbon bonds are
drawn in a zig-zag fashion. The only atoms
specifically written are oxygen, chlorine,
nitrogen etc. The terminals denote methyl
(-CH.,) groups (unless indicated otherwise by
a functional group), while the line junctions
denote carbon atoms bonded to appropriate
number of hydrogens required to satisfy the
valency of the carbon atoms. Some of the
examples are represented as follows:

Three-Dimensional

Representation of Organic
Molecules

The three-dimensional (3-D) structure of
organic molecules can be represented on
paper by using certain conventions. For
example, by using solid (==) and dashed
(“111l) wedge formula, the 3-D image of a
molecule from a two-dimensional picture
can be perceived. In these formulas the
solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond
projecting out of the plane of paper, towards
the observer. The dashed-wedge is used to
depict the bond projecting out of the plane of
the paper and away from the observer. Wedges
are shown in such a way that the broad end of
the wedge is towards the observer. The bonds
lying in plane of the paper are depicted by
using a normal line (—). 3-D representation of
methane molecule on paper has been shown
in Fig. 8.1

Molecular Models

Molecular models are physical devices
that are used for a better visualisation and
perception of three-dimensional shapes
of organic molecules. These are made of
wood, plastic or metal and are commercially
available. Commonly three types of molecular
models are used: (1) Framework model, (2)
Ball-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling
model. In the framework model only the
bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule
and not the atoms themselves are shown.
This model emphasizes the pattern of
bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size
of atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both
the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls
represent atoms and the stick denotes a
bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g.,
ethene) can best be represented by using
springs in place of sticks. These models are
referred to as ball-and-spring model. The
space-filling model emphasises the relative
size of each atom based on its van der Waals
radius. Bonds are not shown in this model.
It conveys the volume occupied by each atom
in the molecule. In addition to these models,
computer graphics can also be used for
molecular modelling.

8.4 CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC
COMPOUNDS

The existing large number of organic
compounds and their ever-increasing
numbers has made it necessary to classify
them on the basis of their structures. Organic
compounds are broadly classified as follows:

Acyclic or Open chain
compounds (I)

Organic
compounds
Cyclic or Closed chain
or Ring compounds (IJ)
Alicyclic Aromatic
compounds compounds
Benzenoid Non-benzenoid
compounds compounds
Homocyclic or Heterocyclic
Carbocyclic compounds
Compounds (Non-aromatic)

Heterocyclic
aromatic compounds

I. Acyclic or open chain compounds

These compounds are also called as aliphatic
compounds and consist of straight or
branched chain compounds, for example:

CH3
CH,CH,
Ethane CH3— CH——CHs
Isobutane
O O
| |
CH3;—— C ——H CH3—— C —— OH

Acetaldehyde Acetic acid

II Cyclic or closed chain or ring
compounds

(a) Alicyclic compounds
Alicyclic (aliphatic cyclic) compounds contain
carbon atoms joined in the form of a ring

(homocyclic).

V OO

Cyclopropane Cyclohexane Cyclohexene

Sometimes atoms other than carbon are
also present in the ring (heterocylic).
Tetrahydrofuran given below is an example
of this type of compound:

)

Tetrahydrofuran

These exhibit some of the properties similar
to those of aliphatic compounds.

(b) Aromatic compounds

Aromatic compounds are special types of
compounds. You will learn about these
compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include
benzene and other related ring compounds
(benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds,
aromatic comounds may also have hetero
atom in the ring. Such compounds are called
hetrocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of
the examples of various types of aromatic
compounds are:

Heterocyclic aromatic compounds

Furan Thiophene Pyridine
Organic compounds can also be classified
on the basis of functional groups, into families
or homologous series.

8.4.1 Functional Group

The functional group is an atom ora group
of atoms joined to the carbon chain which is
responsible for the characteristic chemical
properties of the organic compounds. The
examples are hydroxyl group (—-OH), aldehyde
group (-CHO) and carboxylic acid group (-
COOH) etc.

8.4.2 Homologous Series

A group or a series of organic compounds each
containing a characteristic functional group
forms a homologous series and the members of
the series are called homologues. The members
of a homologous series can be represented by
general molecular formula and the successive
members differ from each other in molecular
formula by a -CH, unit. There are a number
of homologous series of organic compounds.
Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes,
haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones,
alkanoic acids, amines etc.

It is also possible that a compound contains
two or more identical or different functional
groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional
compounds.

8.5 NOMENCLATURE OF. ORGANIC
COMPOUNDS

Organic chemistry deals with millions of
compounds. In order to clearly identify
them, a systematic method of naming has
been developed and is known as the IUPAC
(International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this
systematic nomenclature, the names are
correlated with the structure such that the
reader or listener can deduce the structure
from the name.

Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature,
however, organic compounds were assigned
names based on their origin or certain
properties. For instance, citric acid is named

CHEMISTRY

so because it is found in citrus fruits and the
acid found in red ant is named formic acid
since the Latin word for ant is formica. These
names are traditional and are considered
as trivial or common names. Some common
names are followed even today. For example,
Buckminsterfullerene is a common name
given to the newly discovered C,, cluster (a
form of carbon) noting its structural similarity
to the geodesic domes popularised by the
famous architect R. Buckminster Fuller.
Common names are useful and in many
cases indispensable, particularly when the
alternative systematic names are lengthy and
complicated. Common names of some organic
compounds are given in Table 8.1.

Table 8.1

Common or Trivial Names of Some
Organic Compounds

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY —- SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES 263

By further using prefixes and suffixes, the
parent name can be modified to obtain the
actual name. Compounds containing carbon
and hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons.
A hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it
contains only carbon-carbon single bonds.
The IUPAC name for a homologous series of
such compounds is alkane. Paraffin (Latin:
little affinity) was the earlier name given to
these compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
are those, which contain at least one carbon-
carbon double or triple bond.

8.5.2. IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkanes

Straight chain hydrocarbons: The names
of such compounds are based on their chain
structure, and end with suffix ‘-ane’ and carry
a prefix indicating the number of carbon
atoms present in the chain (except from CH,
to C,H,,, where the prefixes are derived from
trivial names). The IUPAC names of some
straight chain saturated hydrocarbons are
given in Table 8.2. The alkanes in Table
8.2 differ from each other by merely the
number of -CH, groups in the chain. They are
homologues of alkane series.

Saturated Hydrocarbons

Pentane Icosane

Hexane Triacontane

Branched chain hydrocarbons: In a
branched chain compound small chains of
carbon atoms are attached at one or more
carbon atoms of the parent chain. The small
carbon chains (branches) are called alkyl
groups. For example:

CH,-CH-CH,-CH, CHy-CH-CH,-CH-CH,

CH, CH,CH, CH,
(a) (b)

In order to name such compounds, the names
of alkyl groups are prefixed to the name of
parent alkane. An alkyl group is derived
from a saturated hydrocarbon by removing
a hydrogen atom from carbon. Thus, CH,
becomes -CH, and is called methyl group. An
alkyl group is named by substituting ‘yl for
‘ane’ in the corresponding alkane. Some alkyl
groups are listed in Table 8.3.

Abbreviations are used for some alkyl
groups. For example, methyl is abbreviated as
Me, ethyl as Et, propyl as Pr and butyl as Bu.
The alkyl groups can be branched also. Thus,
propyl and butyl groups can have branched
structures as shown below.

Common branched groups have specific
trivial names. For example, the propyl groups
can either be n-propyl group or isopropyl
group. The branched butyl groups are called
sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl group.
We also encounter the structural unit,
-CH,C(CH,),, which is called neopentyl group.

Nomenclature of branched chain alkanes:
We encounter a number of branched chain
alkanes. The rules for naming them are given
below.

First of all, the longest carbon chain in
the molecule is identified. In the example
(I) given below, the longest chain has nine
carbons and it is considered as the parent
or root chain. Selection of parent chain as
shown in (ID is not correct because it has
only eight carbons.

The carbon atoms of the parent chain are
numbered to identify the parent alkane
and to locate the positions of the carbon
atoms at which branching takes place due
to the substitution of alkyl group in place
of hydrogen atoms. The numbering is
done in such a way that the branched
carbon atoms get the lowest possible
numbers. Thus, the numbering in the
above example should be from left to right
(branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and
not from right to left (giving numbers
4 and 8 to the carbon atoms at which
branches are attached).

C C—C
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 #1
C ~ C—C—C ~ C—C—C
C C—C

The names of alkyl groups attached
as a branch are then prefixed to the
name of the parent alkane and position
of the substituents is indicated by the
appropriate numbers. If different alkyl
groups are present, they are listed in
alphabetical order. Thus, name for the
compound shown above is: 6-ethyl-2-
methylnonane. [Note: the numbers are

CHEMISTRY

separated from the groups by hyphens
and there is no break between methyl
and nonane.]

If two or more identical substituent
groups are present then the numbers
are separated by commas. The names of
identical substituents are not repeated,
instead prefixes such as di (for 2), tri
(for 3), tetra (for 4), penta (for 5), hexa (for
6) etc. are used. While writing the name
of the substituents in alphabetical order,
these prefixes, however, are not considered.
Thus, the following compounds are
named as:

CH CH CH CH

If the two substituents are found in
equivalent positions, the lower number
is given to the one coming first in the
alphabetical listing. Thus, the following
compound is 3-ethyl-6-methyloctane and
not 6-ethyl-3-methyloctane.

The name of such branched chain alkyl group
is placed in parenthesis while naming the
compound. While writing the trivial names
of substituents’ in alphabetical order, the
prefixes iso- and neo- are considered to be
the part of the fundamental name of alkyl
group. The prefixes sec- and tert- are not
considered to be the part of the fundamental
name. The use of iso and related common
prefixes for naming alkyl groups is also
allowed by the IUPAC nomenclature as long
as these are not further substituted. In multi-
substituted compounds, the following rules
may aso be remembered:

e If there happens to be two chains of equal
size, then that chain is to be selected which
contains more number of side chains.

e After selection of the chain, numbering
is to be done from the end closer to the
substituent.

8.5.3 Nomenclature of Organic
Compounds having Functional

Group(s)
A functional group, as defined earlier, is an
atom or a group of atoms bonded together in
a unique manner which is usually the site of

Reprint 2025-26

chemical reactivity in an organic molecule.
Compounds having the same functional
group undergo similar reactions. For example,
CH,OH, CH,CH,OH, and (CH,),CHOH —
all having -OH functional group liberate
hydrogen on reaction with sodium metal.
The presence of functional groups enables
systematisation of organic compounds into
different classes. Examples of some functional
groups with their prefixes and suffixes along
with some examples of organic compounds
possessing these are given in Table 8.4.

First of all, the functional group present
in the molecule is identified which determines
the choice of appropriate suffix. The longest
chain of carbon atoms containing the
functional group is numbered in such a way
that the functional group is attached at the
carbon atom possessing lowest possible
number in the chain. By using the suffix as
given in Table 8.4, the name of the compound
is arrived at.

In the case of polyfunctional compounds,
one of the functional groups is chosen as the
principal functional group and the compound
is then named on that basis. The remaining
functional groups, which are subordinate
functional groups, are named as substituents
using the appropriate prefixes. The choice of
principal functional group is made on the basis
of order of preference. The order of decreasing
priority for some functional groups is:

-COOH, -SO,H, -COOR (R=alkyl group), COCI,
-CONH,, -CN,-HC=O, >C=O, -OH, -NH,, >
C=C<, -C=C-.
The —-R, C,H,-, halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), —NO,,
alkoxy (-OR) etc. are always prefix
substituents. Thus, a compound containing
both an alcohol and a keto group is named
as hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is
preferred to the hydroxyl group.

For example, HOCH,(CH,),CH,COCH, will
be named as 7-hydroxyheptan-2-one and not
as 2-oxoheptan -7-ol. Similarly, BrCH,CH=CH,
is named as 3-bromoprop-1l-ene and not
1-bromoprop-2-ene.

If more than one functional group of the
same type are present, their number is
indicated by adding di, tri, etc. before the

CHEMISTRY

class suffix. In such cases the full name of the
parent alkane is written before the class suffix.
For example CH,(OH)CH,(OH) is named as
ethane-1,2-diol. However, the ending — ne of
the parent alkane is dropped in the case of
compounds having more than one double or
triple bond; for example, CH,=CH-CH=CH, is
named as buta—1,3-diene.

bon is octane.

addition, a methyl group is attached

Solution

Here, two functional groups namely
ketone and carboxylic acid are present.
The principal functional group is the
carboxylic acid group; hence the parent
chain will be suffixed with ‘oic’ acid.
Numbering of the chain starts from
carbon of — COOH functional group.
The keto group in the chain at carbon
5 is indicated by ‘oxo’. The longest
chain including the principal functional
group has 6 carbon atoms; hence the
parent hydrocarbon is hexane. The
compound is, therefore, named as
5-Oxohexanoic acid.

Solution

The two C=C functional groups are

the C=C functional group is present at
carbon 5. These groups are indicated by
suffixes ‘diene’ and ‘yne’ respectively. The
longest chain containing the functional
groups has 6 carbon atoms; hence the
parent hydrocarbon is hexane. The name
of compound, therefore, is Hexa-1,3-
dien-5-yne.

Solution

(i) ‘hexane’ indicates the presence of
6 carbon atoms in the chain. The
functional group chloro is present at
carbon 2. Hence, the structure of the
compound is CH,CH,CH,CH,CH(CI)CH,.

(ii) ‘pent’ indicates that parent
hydrocarbon contains 5 carbon atoms
in the chain. ‘en’ and ‘ol’ correspond to
the functional groups C=C and -OH at
carbon atoms 4 and 2 respectively. Thus,
the structure is

CH,=CHCH,CH (OH)CH,.

CHEMISTRY

(iii) Six membered ring containing a
carbon-carbon double bond is implied
by cyclohexene, which is numbered as
shown in (I). The prefix 3-nitro means
that a nitro group is present on C-3.
Thus, complete structural formula of the
compound is (II). Double bond is suffixed

8.5.4 Nomenclature of Substituted
Benzene Compounds

For IUPAC nomenclature of substituted
benzene compounds, the substituent is
placed as prefix to the word benzene as shown
in the following examples. However, common
names (written in bracket below) of many
substituted benzene compounds are also
universally used.

If benzene ring is disubstituted,
the position of substituents is defined
by numbering the carbon atoms of the
ring such that the substituents are
located at the lowest numbers possible.
For example, the compound(b) is named
as 1,3-dibromobenzene and not as
1,5-dibromobenzene.

benzene benzene benzene

In the trivial system of nomenclature
the terms ortho (o), meta (m) and para (p)
are used as prefixes to indicate the relative
positions 1,2;1,3 and 1,4 respectively. Thus,
1,3-dibromobenzene (b) is named as
m-dibromobenzene (meta is abbreviated as
m-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene
1,2-(a) and 1,4-(c), are named as ortho (or
just o-) and para (or just p-)-dibromobenzene,
respectively.

For tri - or higher substituted benzene
derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used
and the compounds are named by identifying
substituent positions on the ring by following
the lowest locant rule. In some cases, common
name of benzene derivatives is taken as the
base compound.

Substituent of the base compound is
assigned numberl and then the direction
of numbering is chosen such that the
next substituent gets the lowest number.
The substituents appear in the name in
alphabetical order. Some examples are given
below.

8.6 ISOMERISM

The phenomenon of existence of two or more
compounds possessing the same molecular
formula but different properties is known
as isomerism. Such compounds are called
as isomers. The following flow chart shows
different types of isomerism.

8.6.1 Structural Isomerism

Compounds having the same molecular
formula but different structures (manners
in which atoms are linked) are classified as
structural isomers. Some typical examples
of different types of structural isomerism are
given below:

(i) Chain isomerism: When two or more
compounds have similar molecular formula but

CHEMISTRY

different carbon skeletons, these are referred
to as chain isomers and the phenomenon is
termed as chain isomerism. For example,
C,H,, represents three compounds:

Isopentane

CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,
Pentane

Neopentane
(2,2-Dimethylpropane)

(ii) Position isomerism: When two or
more compounds differ in the position of
substituent atom or functional group on
the carbon skeleton, they are called position
isomers and this phenomenon is termed
as position isomerism. For example, the
molecular formula C,H,O represents two
alcohols:

ru
CH,CH,CH,OH CH,—-CH-CH,
Propan- 1-ol Propan-2-ol

(iii) Functional group isomerism: Two or
more compounds having the same molecular
formula but different functional groups
are called functional isomers and this
phenomenon is termed as functional group
isomerism. For example, the molecular
formula C,H,O represents an aldehyde and
a ketone:

(iv) Metamerism: It arises due to different
alkyl chains on either side of the functional
group in the molecule. For example, C,H,,O
represents methoxypropane (CH,OC,H.) and
ethoxyethane (C,H,OC,H,).

8.6.2 Stereoisomerism

The compounds that have the same
constitution and sequence of covalent bonds
but differ in relative positions of their atoms
or groups in space are called stereoisomers.
This special type of isomerism is called as
stereoisomerism and can be classified as
geometrical and optical isomerism.

8.7 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN
ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISM

In an organic reaction, the organic molecule
(also referred as a substrate) reacts with an
appropriate attacking reagent and leads to
the formation of one or more intermediate(s)
and finally product(s)

The general reaction is depicted as follows :

Attacking
Reagent [Intermediate] ———> Product(s)

|, Byproducts

Substrate is that reactant which supplies
carbon to the new bond and the other reactant
is called reagent. If both the reactants
supply carbon to the new bond then choice
is arbitrary and in that case the molecule on
which attention is focused is called substrate.

In such a reaction a covalent bond
between two carbon atoms or a carbon and
some other atom is broken and a new bond is
formed. A sequential account of each step,
describing details of electron movement,
energetics during bond cleavage and bond
formation, and the rates of transformation
of reactants into products (kinetics) is
referred to as reaction mechanism. The
knowledge of reaction mechanism helps

Organic
molecule
(Substrate)

in understanding the reactivity of organic
compounds and in planning strategy for their
synthesis.

In the following sections, we shall learn
some of the principles that explain how these
reactions take place.

8.7.1 Fission of a Covalent Bond

A covalent bond can get cleaved either by : (i)
heterolytic cleavage, or by (ii) homolytic
cleavage.

In heterolytic cleavage, the bond breaks
in such a fashion that the shared pair of
electrons remains with one of the fragments.

After heterolysis, one atom has a sextet
electronic structure and a positive charge and
the other, a valence octet with at least one lone
pair and a negative charge. Thus, heterolytic
cleavage of bromomethane will give CH, and
Br as shown below.

+ -
H,C Oh —> H,C + Br

A species having a carbon atom possessing
sextext of electrons and a positive charge is
called a carbocation (earlier called carbonium
ion). The @ H, ion is known as a methyl cation
or methyl carbonium ion. Carbocations are
classified as primary, secondary or tertiary
depending on whether one, two or three
carbons are directly attached to the positively
charged carbon. Some other examples of
carbocations are: CH, CH, (ethyl cation, a
primary carbocation), (CH, ), CH (isopropyl
cation, a secondary carbocation), and (CH.,)., GC
(tert-butyl cation, a tertiary carbocation).
Carbocations are highly unstable and
reactive species. Alkyl groups directly
attached to the positively charged carbon
stabilise the carbocations due to inductive
and hyperconjugation effects, which you will
be studying in the sections 8.7.5 and 8.7.9.
The observed, order of carbocation stability
is: CH, < CH, CH, < (CH,), CH < (CH,), C. These
carbocations have trigonal planar shape
with positively charged carbon being sp?
hybridised. Thus, the shape of CH, may be
considered as being derived from the overlap
of three equivalent C(sp’) hybridised orbitals
with 1s orbital of each of the three hydrogen

atoms. Each bond may be represented as
C(sp?)-H(1s) sigma bond. The remaining
carbon orbital is perpendicular to the
molecular plane and contains no electrons.
[Fig. 8.3(a)].

Fig. 8.3(a) Shape of methyl carbocation

The heterolytic cleavage can also give a
species in which carbon gets the shared
pair of electrons. For example, when group
Z attached to the carbon leaves without

_ +
CH, —— Z ——>H,C: + Z
electron pair, the methyl anion (H,c:] is

formed. Such a carbon species carrying a
negative charge on carbon atom is called
carbanion. Carbon in carbanion is generally
sp® hybridised and its structure is distorted
tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8.3(b).

—Chie-H

H H
Fig. 8.3(b) Shape of methyl carbanion

Carbanions are also unstable and reactive
species. The organic reactions which proceed
through heterolytic bond cleavage are called
ionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions.

In homolytic cleavage, one of the electrons
of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes
with each of the bonded atoms. Thus, in
homolytic cleavage, the movement of a
single electron takes place instead of an
electron pair. The single electron movement
is shown by ‘half-headed’ (fish hook:—)

CHEMISTRY

curved arrow. Such cleavage results in
the formation of neutral species (atom or
group) which contains an unpaired electron.
These species are called free radicals. Like
carbocations and carbanions, free radicals are
also very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be
shown as:
w- Heat or Light .
R—xX ——— R + Xx

Alkyl radicals are classified as primary,
secondary, or tertiary. Alkyl radical stability
increases as we proceed from primary to
tertiary:

Organic reactions, which proceed by
homolytic fission are called free radical or
homopolar or nonpolar reactions.

8.7.2 Substrate and Reagent

Ions are generally not formed in the reactions
of organic compounds. Molecules as such
participate in the reaction. It is convenient to
name one reagent as substrate and other as
reagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon
is involved in new bond formation is called
substrate and the other one is called reagent.
When carbon-carbon bond is formed, the
choice of naming the reactants as substrate
and reagent is arbitrary and depends on
molecule under observation. Example:

(i) CH,=CH, + Br, > CH, Br-CH,Br

Substrate Reagent Product
(ii) <i
Ss + CH,Cl ——> +HCl
Reagent Product
(Substrate) Product

Nucleophiles and Electrophiles

Reagents attack the reactive site of the
substrate. The reactive site may be electron

Unit 8.indd 273

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY —- SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES 273

deficient portion of the molecule (a positive
reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete
electron shell or the positive end of the dipole
in the molecule. If the attacking species is
electron rich, it attacks these sites. Ifattacking
species is electron deficient, the reactive site
for it is that part of the substrate molecule
which can supply electrons, e.g., electrons
in a double bond.

A reagent that brings an electron pair to
the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:)
i.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then
called nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away
an electron pair from reactive site is called
electrophile (E*) i.e., electron seeking and the
reaction is called electrophilic.

During a polar organic reaction, a
nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre
of the substrate which is that specific atom
or part of the substrate which is electron
deficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack
at nucleophilic centre, which is the electron
rich centre of the substrate. Thus, the
electrophiles receive electron pair from the
substrate when the two undergo bonding
interaction. A curved-arrow notation is used
to show the movement of an electron pair
from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Some
examples of nucleophiles are the negatively
charged ions with lone pair of electrons such
as hydroxide (HO ), cyanide (NC*) ions and
carbanions (R,C:). Neutral molecules such
as H,O:, R,N:, R,NH etc., can also act as
nucleophiles due to the presence of lone
pair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles
include carbocations (CH,) and neutral
molecules having functional groups like
carbonyl group (>C=O) or alkyl halides
(R,C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The
carbon atom in carbocations has sextet
configuration; hence, it is electron deficient
and can receive a pair of electrons from the
nucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as
alkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X
bond a partial positive charge is generated
on the carbon atom and hence the carbon
atom becomes an electrophilic centre at which
a nucleophile can attack.

8.7.3. Electron Movement in Organic

reactions can be shown by curved-arrow

notation. It shows how changes in bonding
occur due to electronic redistribution during
the reaction. To show the change in position
of a pair of electrons, curved arrow starts
from the point from where an electron pair is
shifted and it ends at a location to which the
pair of electron may move.

Presentation of shifting of electron pair is
given below :

(i) Ly > _ Ya from mt bond to 7
adjacent bond position

(ii) Ly _e > _Vy— from m bond to
adjacent atom

(iii) __ vy <—>_Y= from atom to adjacent
bond position

Movement of single electron is indicated by
a single barbed ‘fish hooks’ (i.e. half headed
curved arrow). For example, in transfer of
hydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the
dissociation of chloromethane, the movement
of electron using curved arrows can be
depicted as follows:

8.7.4 Electron Displacement Effects in
Covalent Bonds

The electron displacement in an organic
molecule may take place either in the ground
state under the influence of an atom or a
substituent group or in the presence of an
appropriate attacking reagent. The electron
displacements due to the influence of
an atom or a substituent group present in
the molecule cause permanent polarlisation
of the bond. Inductive effect and resonance
effects are examples of this type of electron
displacements. Temporary electron
displacement effects are seen in a molecule
when a reagent approaches to attack it.
This type of electron displacement is called
electromeric effect or polarisability effect.
In the following sections we will learn about
these types of electronic displacements.

CHEMISTRY

8.7.5 Inductive Effect

When a covalent bond is formed between
atoms of different electronegativity, the
electron density is more towards the more
electronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift
of electron density results in a polar covalent
bond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic
effects in organic compounds.

Let us consider cholorethane (CH,CH,Cl)
in which the C-Cl bond is a polar covalent
bond. It is polarised in such a way that the
carbon-1 gains some positive charge (6*)
and the chlorine some negative charge (6).
The fractional electronic charges on the two
atoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted
by symbol 6 (delta) and the shift of electron
density is shown by an arrow that points from
6* to 5: end of the polar bond.

56° 5* o
CH;—>—CH, >—Cl
1

In turn carbon-1, which has developed
partial positive charge (6*) draws some
electron density towards it from the adjacent
C-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge
(55*) develops on carbon-2 also, where 66*
symbolises relatively smaller positive charge
as compared to that on carbon - 1. In other
words, the polar C — Cl bond induces polarity
in the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of
o-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent
o-bond is referred to as the inductive effect.
This effect is passed on to the subsequent
bonds also but the effect decreases rapidly
as the number of intervening bonds increases
and becomes vanishingly small after three
bonds. The inductive effect is related to the
ability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or
donate electron density to the attached carbon
atom. Based on this ability, the substitutents
can be classified as electron-withdrawing or
electron donating groups relative to hydrogen.
Halogens and many other groups such as
nitro (- NO,), cyano (- CN), carboxy (- COOH),
ester (COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. -OC,H,), etc.
are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other
hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (-CH,) and
ethyl (-CH,-CH,) are usually considered as
electron donating groups.

than H, (b) C—O, (c) C-O

Problem 8.15

In which C-C bond of CH,CH,CH,Br, the
inductive effect is expected to be the least?

Solution

Magnitude of inductive effect diminishes
as the number of intervening bonds
increases. Hence, the effect is least in the
bond between carbon-3 and hydrogen.

8.7.6 Resonance Structure

There are many organic molecules whose
behaviour cannot be explained by a single Lewis
structure. An example is that of
benzene. Its cyclic structure
containing alternating C-—C single CO
and C=C double bonds shown

is inadequate for explaining its Benzene
characteristic properties.

As per the above representation, benzene
should exhibit two different bond lengths,
due to C-C single and C=C double bonds.
However, as determined experimentally
benzene has a uniform C-C bond distances
of 139 pm, a value intermediate between the
C-C single(154 pm) and C=C double (134
pm) bonds. Thus, the structure of benzene
cannot be represented adequately by the
above structure. Further, benzene can be
represented equally well by the energetically
identical structures I and II.

OO:

Therefore, according to the resonance
theory (Unit 4) the actual structure of

benzene cannot be adequately represented
by any of these structures, rather it is
a hybrid of the two structures (I and ID)
called resonance structures. The resonance
structures (canonical structures or
contributing structures) are hypothetical
and individually do not represent any
real molecule. They contribute to the actual
structure in proportion to their stability.

Another example of resonance is provided
by nitromethane (CH,NO,) which can be
represented by two Lewis structures, (I and
II). There are two types of N-O bonds in these
structures.

+ Co: 4 OF
CH-NZ™ gS CH, re

O:

I~ II Co
However, it is known that the two N-O
bonds of nitromethane are of the same
length (intermediate between a N-O single
bond and a N=O double bond). The actual
structure of nitromethane is therefore

a resonance hybrid of the two canonical
forms I and II.

The energy of actual structure of the molecule
(the resonance hybrid) is lower than that of
any of the canonical structures. The difference
in energy between the actual structure and the
lowest energy resonance structure is called the
resonance stabilisation energy or simply
the resonance energy. The more the number
of important contributing structures, the
more is the resonance energy. Resonance is
particularly important when the contributing
structures are equivalent in energy.

The following rules are applied while writing
resonance structures:

The resonance structures have (i) the same
positions of nuclei and (ii) the same number of
unpaired electrons. Among the resonance
structures, the one which has more number
of covalent bonds, all the atoms with octet
of electrons (except hydrogen which has a
duplet), less separation of opposite charges, (a
negative charge if any on more electronegative
atom, a positive charge if any on more
electropositive atom) and more dispersal of
charge, is more stable than others.

The resonance effect is defined as ‘the polarity
produced in the molecule by the interaction
of two m-bonds or between a m-bond and
lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent
atom’. The effect is transmitted through the
chain. There are two types of resonance or
mesomeric effect designated as R or M effect.

(i) Positive Resonance Effect (4R effect)

In this effect, the transfer of electrons is away
from an atom or substituent group attached
to the conjugated system. This electron
displacement makes certain positions in the
molecule of high electron densities. This effect
in aniline is shown as :

(ti) Negative Resonance Effect (- R effect)

This effect is observed when the transfer of
electrons is towards the atom or substituent
group attached to the conjugated system.

displacement can be depicted as :

The presence of alternate single and
double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system
is termed as a conjugated system. These
systems often show abnormal behaviour.
The examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline
and nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the
m-electrons are delocalised and the system
develops polarity.

8.7.8 Electromeric Effect (E effect)

Itis a temporary effect. The organic compounds
having a multiple bond (a double or triple
bond) show this effect in the presence of
an attacking reagent only. It is defined as
the complete transfer of a shared pair of
m-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a
multiple bond on the demand of an attacking
reagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the
attacking reagent is removed from the domain
of the reaction. It is represented by E and the
shifting of the electrons is shown by a curved
arrow (/ ¥). There are two distinct types of
electromeric effect.

(i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In
this effect the m-electrons of the multiple
bond are transferred to that atom to which
the reagent gets attached. For example:

x, CXL . 7 L

-C =Cl +H—> SC-Co
(attacking |
reagent) H

(ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (-E effect) In
this effect the x - electrons of the multiple
bond are transferred to that atom to which
the attacking reagent does not get attached.
For example:

(VY = -

SC =C< + CN —> SC-CK
(attacking

reagent) CN

When inductive and electromeric effects
operate in opposite directions, the electomeric
effect predominates.

8.7.9 Hyperconjugation

Hyperconjugation is a general stabilising
interaction. It involves delocalisation of
o electrons of C—H bond of an alkyl group
directly attached to an atom of unsaturated

system or to an atom with an unshared
p orbital. The o electrons of C—H bond of the
alkyl group enter into partial conjugation with
the attached unsaturated system or with the
unshared p orbital. Hyperconjugation is a
permanent effect.

To understand hyperconjugation effect, let
us take an example of CH, CH, (ethyl cation) in
which the positively charged carbon atom has
an empty p orbital. One of the C-H bonds of
the methyl group can align in the plane of this
empty p orbital and the electrons constituting
the C-H bond in plane with this p orbital can
then be delocalised into the empty p orbital
as depicted in Fig. 8.4 (a).

Hyperconjugation

<— empty 2p orbital

hyperconjugation in ethyl cation

This type of overlap stabilises the
carbocation because electron density from
the adjacent o bond helps in dispersing the
positive charge.

In general, greater the number of alkyl
groups attached to a positively charged carbon
atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation
interaction and stabilisation of the cation.
Thus, we have the following relative stability
of carbocations :

Hyperconjugation is also possible in

Delocalisation of electrons by

hyperconjugation in the case of alkene can
be depicted as in Fig. 8.4(b).

hyperconjugation in propene

There are various ways of looking at the
hyperconjugative effect. One of the way is to
regard C—H bond as possessing partial ionic
character due to resonance.

Types of Organic Reactions and
Mechanisms

Organic reactions can be classified into the
following categories:

(i) Substitution reactions

(ii) Addition reactions

(iii) Elimination reactions

(iv) Rearrangement reactions

You will be studying these reactions in
Unit 9 and later in class XII.

8.8. METHODS OF PURIFICATION OF
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

Once an organic compound is extracted
from a natural source or synthesised in the
laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various
methods used for the purification of organic
compounds are based on the nature of the
compound and the impurity present in it.
The common techniques used for
purification are as follows :
() Sublimation
(ii) Crystallisation
(iii) Distillation
(iv) Differential extraction and
(v) Chromatography
Finally, the purity of a compound is
ascertained by determining its melting or
boiling point. Most of the pure compounds
have sharp melting points and boiling points.
New methods of checking the purity of an
organic compound are based on different

Reprint 2025-26

10/10/2022 10:37:35 AM

Unit 8.indd 279

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY —- SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES 279

types of chromatographic and spectroscopic
techniques.

8.8.1

You have learnt earlier that on heating, some
solid substances change from solid to vapour
state without passing through liquid state.
The purification technique based on the above
principle is known as sublimation and is used
to separate sublimable compounds from non-
sublimable impurities.

8.8.2

This is one of the most commonly used
techniques for the purification of solid organic
compounds. It is based on the difference in
the solubilities of the compound and the
impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure
compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it
is sparingly soluble at room temperature but
appreciably soluble at higher temperature.
The solution is concentrated to get a nearly
saturated solution. On cooling the solution,
pure compound crystallises out and is
removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother
liquor) contains impurities and small quantity
of the compound. If the compound is highly
soluble in one solvent and very little soluble
in another solvent, crystallisation can be
satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these
solvents. Impurities, which impart colour to
the solution are removed by adsorbing over
activated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation
becomes necessary for the purification
of compounds containing impurities of
comparable solubilities.

Sublimation

Crystallisation

8.8.3 Distillation

This important method is used to separate
(i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities
and (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference
in their boiling points. Liquids having
different boiling points vaporise at different
temperatures. The vapours are cooled and
the liquids so formed are collected separately.
Chloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457
K) are easily separated by the technique of
distillation (Fig 8.5). The liquid mixture is
taken in a round bottom flask and heated

carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower
boiling component are formed first. The
vapours are condensed by using a condenser
and the liquid is collected in a receiver.
The vapours of higher boiling component
form later and the liquid can be collected
separately.

substance formed are condensed and

Fractional Distillation: If the difference
in boiling points of two liquids is not much,
simple distillation cannot be used to separate
them. The vapours of such liquids are formed
within the same temperature range and are
condensed simultaneously. The technique of
fractional distillation is used in such cases. In
this technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are
passed through a fractionating column before
condensation. The fractionating column is
fitted over the mouth of the round bottom
flask (Fig.8.6, page 280).

Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling
point condense before the vapours of the
liquid with lower boiling point. The vapours
rising up in the fractionating column become
richer in more volatile component. By the

time the vapours reach to the top of the
fractionating column, these are rich in the
more volatile component. Fractionating
columns are available in various sizes and
designs as shown in Fig.8.7. A fractionating
column provides many surfaces for heat
exchange between the ascending vapours
and the descending condensed liquid. Some
of the condensing liquid in the fractionating
column obtains heat from the ascending
vapours and revaporises. The vapours thus
become richer in low boiling component. The
vapours of low boiling component ascend
to the top of the column. On reaching the
top, the vapours become pure in low boiling
component and pass through the condenser
and the pure liquid is collected in a receiver.
After a series of successive distillations, the
remaining liquid in the distillation flask gets
enriched in high boiling component. Each
successive condensation and vaporisation

CHEMISTRY

unit in the fractionating column is called a
theoretical plate. Commercially, columns
with hundreds of plates are available.

One of the technological applications of
fractional distillation is to separate different
fractions of crude oil in petroleum industry.
Distillation under reduced
pressure: This method is
used to purify liquids having
very high boiling points and
those, which decompose at
or below their boiling points.
Such liquids are made to boil
at a temperature lower than
their normal boiling points
by reducing the pressure on
their surface. A liquid boils
at a temperature at which its
vapour pressure is equal to
the external pressure. The
pressure is reduced with
the help of a water pump
or vacuum pump (Fig.8.8).
Glycerol can be separated from
spent-lye in soap industry by
using this technique.

Fig.8.8 Distillation under reduced pressure. A liquid boils at a temperature below its
vapour pressure by reducing the pressure.

Steam Distillation: This technique is
applied to separate substances which are
steam volatile and are immiscible with water.
In steam distillation, steam from a steam
generator is passed through a heated flask
containing the liquid to be distilled. The
mixture of steam and the volatile organic
compound is condensed and collected. The
compound is later separated from water using
a separating funnel. In steam distillation,
the liquid boils when the sum of vapour
pressures due to the organic liquid (p,)
and that due to water (p,) becomes equal to
the atmospheric pressure (p), i.e. p =p,+ P,.
Since p, is lower than p, the organic liquid
vaporises at lower temperature than its
boiling point.

Thus, if one of the substances in the
mixture is water and the other, a water
insoluble substance, then the mixture will boil
close to but below, 373K. A mixture of water
and the substance is obtained which can
be separated by using a separating funnel.
Aniline is separated by this technique from
aniline - water mixture (Fig.8.9, Page 282).

8.8.4 _. Differential Extraction

When an organic compound is present in an
aqueous medium, it is separated by shaking
it with an organic solvent in which it is more
soluble than in water. The organic solvent and
the aqueous solution should be immiscible
with each other so that they form two distinct
layers which can be separated by separatory
funnel. The organic solvent is later removed
by distillation or by evaporation to get back
the compound. Differential extraction is
carried out in a separatory funnel as shown in
Fig. 8.10 (Page 282). If the organic compound
is less soluble in the organic solvent, a very
large quantity of solvent would be required
to extract even a very small quantity of the
compound. The technique of continuous
extraction is employed in such cases. In this
technique same solvent is repeatedly used for
extraction of the compound.

8.8.5 Chromatography

Chromatography is an important technique
extensively used to separate mixtures into
their components, purify compounds and
also to test the purity of compounds. The

name chromatography is based on the Greek
word chroma, for colour since the method
was first used for the separation of coloured
substances found in plants. In this technique,
the mixture of substances is applied onto a
stationary phase, which may be a solid or a
liquid. A pure solvent, a mixture of solvents,
or a gas is allowed to move slowly over the
stationary phase. The components of the
mixture get gradually separated from one
another. The moving phase is called the
mobile phase.

Based on the principle involved,
chromatography is classified into different
categories. Two of these are:

(a) Adsorption chromatography, and
(b) Partition chromatography.

a) Adsorption Chromatography: Adsor-
ption chromatography is based on the fact
that different compounds are adsorbed on
an adsorbent to different degrees. Commonly
used adsorbents are silica gel and alumina.
When a mobile phase is allowed to move
over a stationary phase (adsorbent), the
components of the mixture move by varying

are two main types of chromatographic
techniques based on the principle of differential

(b) Thin layer chromatography.

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY —- SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES 283

Column Chromatography: Column
chromatography involves separation of
a mixture over a column of adsorbent
(stationary phase) packed in a glass tube.
The column is fitted with a stopcock at its
lower end (Fig. 8.11). The mixture adsorbed
on adsorbent is placed on the top of the
adsorbent column packed in a glass tube.
An appropriate eluant which is a liquid or a
mixture of liquids is allowed to flow down the
column slowly. Depending upon the degree to
which the compounds are adsorbed, complete
separation takes place. The most readily
adsorbed substances are retained near the top
and others come down to various distances
in the column (Fig.8.11).

Thin Layer Chromatography: Thin layer
chromatography (TLC) is another type of
adsorption chromatography, which involves
separation of substances of a mixture over
a thin layer of an adsorbent coated on glass
plate. A thin layer (about 0.2mm thick) of
an adsorbent (silica gel or alumina) is spread
over a glass plate of suitable size. The plate
is known as thin layer chromatography plate
or chromaplate. The solution of the mixture
to be separated is applied as a small spot
about 2 cm above one end of the TLC plate.

The glass plate is then placed in a closed jar
containing the eluant (Fig. 8.12a). As the
eluant rises up the plate, the components of
the mixture move up along with the eluant to
different distances depending on their degree
of adsorption and separation takes place.
The relative adsorption of each component
of the mixture is expressed in terms of its
retardation factor i.e. R r value (Fig.8.12 b).

The spots of coloured compounds are
visible on TLC plate due to their original colour.
The spots of colourless compounds, which are
invisible to the eye but fluoresce in ultraviolet
light, can be detected by putting the plate under
ultraviolet light. Another detection technique
is to place the plate in a covered jar containing
a few crystals of iodine. Spots of compounds,
which adsorb iodine, will show up as brown
spots. Sometimes an appropriate reagent
may also be sprayed on the plate. For example,
amino acids may be detected by spraying the
plate with ninhydrin solution (Fig.8.12b).

Partition Chromatography: Partition
chromatography is based on continuous
differential partitioning of components of
a mixture between stationary and mobile
phases. Paper chromatography is a type
of partition chromatography. In paper
chromatography, a special quality paper
known as chromatography paper is used.
Chromatography paper contains water trapped
in it, which acts as the stationary phase.

A strip of chromatography paper spotted
at the base with the solution of the mixture is
suspended in a suitable solvent or a mixture
of solvents (Fig. 8.13). This solvent acts as the
mobile phase. The solvent rises up the paper
by capillary action and flows over the spot. The
paper selectively retains different components
according to their differing partition in the
two phases. The paper strip so developed is
known as a chromatogram. The spots of the
separated coloured compounds are visible at
different heights from the position of initial

the use of an appropriate spray reagent as
discussed under thin layer chromatography.

8.9 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC
COMPOUNDS

The elements present in organic compounds
are carbon and hydrogen. In addition to
these, they may also contain oxygen, nitrogen,
sulphur, halogens and phosphorus.

8.9.1 Detection of Carbon and Hydrogen

Carbon and hydrogen are detected by heating
the compound with copper(II) oxide. Carbon
present in the compound is oxidised to
carbon dioxide (tested with lime-water, which
develops turbidity) and hydrogen to water
(tested with anhydrous copper sulphate,
which turns blue).

8.9.2 Detection of Other Elements

Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus
present in an organic compound are detected
by “Lassaigne’s test”. The elements present
in the compound are converted from covalent
form into the ionic form by fusing the
compound with sodium metal. Following
reactions take place:

Cyanide, sulphide and halide of sodium so
formed on sodium fusion are extracted from
the fused mass by boiling it with distilled
water. This extract is known as sodium fusion
extract.

(A) Test for Nitrogen

The sodium fusion extract is boiled with
iron(II) sulphate and then acidified with

concentrated sulphuric acid. The formation
of Prussian blue colour confirms the presence
of nitrogen. Sodium cyanide first reacts
with iron(II)sulphate and forms sodium
hexacyanidoferrate(II). On heating with
concentrated sulphuric acid some iron(II
ions are oxidised to iron(III) ions which
react with sodium hexacyanidoferrate(II)
to produce iron(III) hexacyanidoferrate(II)
(ferriferrocyanide) which is Prussian blue in
colour.

The sodium fusion extract is acidified with
nitric acid and then treated with silver nitrate.

ammonium hydroxide shows the presence of

bromine and a yellow precipitate, insoluble

X represents a halogen — Cl, Br or I.

If nitrogen or sulphur is also present in the
compound, the sodium fusion extract is
first boiled with concentrated nitric acid to
decompose cyanide or sulphide of sodium
formed during Lassaigne’s test. These ions
would otherwise interfere with silver nitrate
test for halogens.

(D) Test for Phosphorus

The compound is heated with an oxidising
agent (sodium peroxide). The phosphorus
present in the compound is oxidised to
phosphate. The solution is boiled with nitric
acid and then treated with ammonium
molybdate. A yellow colouration or precipitate
indicates the presence of phosphorus.

8.10 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

Quantitative analysis of compounds is very
important in organic chemistry. It helps
chemists in the determination of mass per
cent of elements present in a compound. You
have learnt in Unit-1 that mass per cent of
elements is required for the determination of
emperical and molecular formula.

The percentage composition of elements
present in an organic compound is determined
by the following methods:

8.10.1 Carbon and Hydrogen

Both carbon and hydrogen are estimated in
one experiment. A known mass of an organic
compound is burnt in the presence of excess
of oxygen and copper(II) oxide. Carbon and
hydrogen in the compound are oxidised to
carbon dioxide and water respectively.

Estimation of carbon and hydrogen. Water and carbon dioxide formed on oxidation of substance

are absorbed in anhydrous calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide solutions respectively

contained in U tubes.

The mass of water produced is determined
by passing the mixture through a weighed
U-tube containing anhydrous calcium chloride.
Carbon dioxide is absorbed in another U-tube
containing concentrated solution of potassium
hydroxide. These tubes are connected in series
(Fig. 8.14). The increase in masses of calcium
chloride and potassium hydroxide gives the
amounts of water and carbon dioxide from
which the percentages of carbon and hydrogen
are calculated.

Let the mass of organic compound be

produced be m, and m, g respectively;

8.10.2 Nitrogen

There are two methods for estimation of
nitrogen: (i) Dumas method and (ii) Kjeldahl’s
method.

(i) Dumas method: The nitrogen containing
organic compound, when heated with copper
oxide in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide,
yields free nitrogen in addition to carbon
dioxide and water.

Traces of nitrogen oxides formed, if
any, are reduced to nitrogen by passing the
gaseous mixture over a heated copper gauze.
The mixture of gases so produced is collected
over an aqueous solution of potassium
hydroxide which absorbs carbon dioxide.
Nitrogen is collected in the upper part of the
graduated tube (Fig.8.15).

Where p, and V, are the pressure and
volume of nitrogen, p, is different from the

the relation;

(ii) Kjeldahl’s method: The compound
containing nitrogen is heated with concentrated
sulphuric acid. Nitrogen in the compound
gets converted to ammonium sulphate
(Fig. 8.16). The resulting acid mixture is then
heated with excess of sodium hydroxide.
The liberated ammonia gas is absorbed in
an excess of standard solution of sulphuric
acid. The amount of ammonia produced is
determined by estimating the amount of
sulphuric acid consumed in the reaction. It
is done by estimating unreacted sulphuric
acid left after the absorption of ammonia by

8.10.6 Oxygen

The percentage of oxygen in an organic compound
is usually found by difference between the total

percentage composition (100) and the sum of
the percentages of all other elements. However,
oxygen can also be estimated directly as follows:

A definite mass of an organic compound is
decomposed by heating in a stream of nitrogen
gas. The mixture of gaseous products containing
oxygen is passed over red-hot coke when all
the oxygen is converted to carbon monoxide.
This mixture is passed through warm iodine
pentoxide (I1,0,) when carbon monoxide is
oxidised to carbon dioxide producing iodine.

On making the amount of CO produced in
equation (A) equal to the amount of CO used
in equation (B) by multiplying the equations
(A) and (B) by 5 and 2 respectively; we find
that each mole of oxygen liberated from
the compound will produce two moles of
carbondioxide.

Thus 88 g carbon dioxide is obtained if 32 g
oxygen is liberated.

Mass of carbon dioxide produced be m, g

Presently, the estimation of elements in
an organic compound is carried out by using
microquantities of substances and automatic
experimental techniques. The elements,
carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen present in a
compound are determined by an apparatus
known as CHN elemental analyser. The
analyser requires only a very small amount
of the substance (1-3 mg) and displays the
values on a screen within a short time. A
detailed discussion of such methods is beyond
the scope of this book.

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY —- SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES

SUMMARY

In this unit, we have learnt some basic concepts in structure and reactivity of organic
compounds, which are formed due to covalent bonding. The nature of the covalent bonding
in organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept,
according to which carbon can have sp’, sp? and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp’, sp? and sp
hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively.
The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can
be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp* hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital
of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C-H) single bond (sigma, o bond). Overlap of a sp”
orbital of one carbon with sp? orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon-carbon
o bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-
by-side) overlap to give a pi (n) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various
structural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper
can be drawn by wedge and dash formula.

Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional
groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a
unique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds.
The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC nomenclature,
the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the
structure from the name.

Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate
molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects
and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making
of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion.
A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives
free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage
involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as
nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance,
electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making
certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.

Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition,
elimination and rearrangement reactions.

Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out
for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation
and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties.
Chromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of
compounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography.
Adsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a
mixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the
components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound
in a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it.
Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by Lassaigne’s test. Carbon and
hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced.
Nitrogen is estimated by Dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method.
Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids
respectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total
percentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.
