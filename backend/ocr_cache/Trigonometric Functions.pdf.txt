“4 mathematician knows how to solve a problem,

3.1 Introduction

The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words
‘trigon’ and ‘metron’ and it means ‘measuring the sides of
a triangle’. The subject was originally developed to solve
geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by
sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new
lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is
used in many areas such as the science of seismology,
designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,
predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a
musical tone and in many other areas.

In earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric
ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right

angled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of

trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this

Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions

and study their properties.

Angle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is

called the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the
terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of
rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation

is clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1). A

The measure of an angle is the amount of Initial side
rotation performed to get the terminal side from @ f Terminal Side B
the initial side. There are several units for
measuring angles. The definition of an angle Fig 3.2
suggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as
indicated in Fig 3.2.

This is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly
spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe
two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.
degree measure and radian measure.

3.2.1 Degree measure Ifarotation from the initial side to terminal side is =a) of

a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as 1°. A degree is
divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth ofa degree is
called a minute, written as 1’, and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as 1”.
Thus, 1° = 60’, 1'=60"

Some of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, — 30°, — 420° are
shown in Fig 3.3.

3.2.2. Radian measure There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called
the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length | unit ina
unit circle (circle of radius | unit) is said to have a measure of | radian. In the Fig
3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the

angles whose measures are | radian, —1 radian, Is radian and —1 5 radian.

We know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 27. Thus, one
complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of 27 radian.

More generally, in a circle of radius 7, an arc of length v will subtend an angle of
1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.
Since in a circle of radius 7, an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is |
radian, an arc of length / will subtend an angle whose measure is radian. Thus, if in

acircle of radius 7, an arc of length / subtends an angle 0 radian at the centre, we have

3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers
Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let Abe any point
on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.
Then the length ofan arc of the circle will give the radian 1
measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the

centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is

tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the 0
real number zero, AP represents positive real number and

AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we

rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the

circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real

number will correspond to a radian measure and 2
conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can Fig 3.5 Q
be considered as one and the same.

3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian Since a circle subtends at the centre
an angle whose radian measure is 27 and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that

2n radian =360° or  wmradian = 180°

The above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree
measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value

of m as 7° we have

Notational Convention
Since angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention
that whenever we write angle 0°, we mean the angle whose degree measure is 0 and
whenever we write angle 8, we mean the angle whose radian measure is B.

Note that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word ‘radian’ is frequently

1 1
omitted. Thus, 7 =180° and 4" 45° are written with the understanding that x and 4

are radian measures. Thus, we can say that

In earlier classes, we have studied trigonometric ratios for acute angles as the ratio of
sides of a right angled triangle. We will now extend the definition of trigonometric
ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.

Consider a unit circle with centre
at origin of the coordinate axes. Let
P (a, 6) be any point on the circle with
angle AOP =x radian, i.e., length of arc
AP = x (Fig 3.6).

We define cos x= a and sinx = b
Since AOMP is aright triangle, we have

OM? + MP? = OP’ or a? + Bb? = 1
Thus, for every point on the unit circle,
we have

a’ + b?= 1 or cos’x + sin’x = |

quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively,
(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0) and (0, —1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have

Now, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to
same point P. Thus, we also observe that if x increases (or decreases) by any integral
multiple of 27, the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,

sin (2nn +x) =sinx,n eZ, cos(2nn+x)=cosx,neZ

We have shown that for all real x, sin?x + cos?x = 1
It follows that

1 + tan?x = sec*x (why?)

1 + cot?x = cosec* x (why?)

In earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for 0°,
30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same
as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following
table:

The values of cosec x, sec x and cot x Y

cos x and tan x, respectively.

Historical Note

The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and
Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from
India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the
study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian
approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.

In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main
contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of
mathematics.

Bhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for
sines or cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., are given by
Bhaskara II.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

The symbols sin! x, cos! x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were
suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:

2 =— =i ’s altitud
Sy an (sun’s altitude)

Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through
the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance
using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.
