Albert Einstein

Chemical energy stored by molecules can be released as
heat during chemical reactions when a fuel like methane,
cooking gas or coal burns in air. The chemical energy may
also be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns
in an engine or to provide electrical energy through a
galvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy
are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may
be transformed from one form into another. The study
of these energy transformations forms the subject matter
of thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal
with energy changes of macroscopic systems involving
a large number of molecules rather than microscopic
systems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is
not concerned about how and at what rate these energy
transformations are carried out, but is based on initial and
final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of
thermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium
or moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium
state. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature
do not change with time for a system in equilibrium state.
In this unit, we would like to answer some of the important
questions through thermodynamics, like:

How do we determine the energy changes involved in a
chemical reaction/ process? Will it occur or not?

What drives a chemical reaction/ process?
To what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?

THERMODYNAMICS

5.1 THERMODYNAMIC TERMS

We are interested in chemical reactions and
the energy changes accompanying them. For
this we need to know certain thermodynamic
terms. These are discussed below.

5.1.1 The System and the Surroundings

A system in thermodynamics refers to that
part of universe in which observations are
made and remaining universe constitutes
the surroundings. The surroundings include
everything other than the system. System
and the surroundings together constitute the
universe.

The universe = The system + The surroundings

However, the entire universe other than
the system is not affected by the changes
taking place in the system. Therefore, for all
practical purposes, the surroundings are that
portion of the remaining universe which can
interact with the system. Usually, the region
of space in the neighbourhood of the system
constitutes its surroundings.

For example, if we are studying the
reaction between two substances A and B
kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the
reaction mixture is the system and the room
where the beaker is kept is the surroundings
(Fig. 5.1).

Surroundings

Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundings

Note that the system may be defined
by physical boundaries, like beaker or test
tube, or the system may simply be defined
by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying
a particular volume in space. It is necessary
to think of the system as separated from the
surroundings by some sort of wall which may
be real or imaginary. The wall that separates

137

the system from the surroundings is called
boundary. This is designed to allow us to
control and keep track of all movements of
matter and energy in or out of the system.

5.1.2 Types of the System

We, further classify the systems according
to the movements of matter and energy in or
out of the system.

1. Open System

In an open system, there is exchange of energy
and matter between system and surroundings
[Fig. 5.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an
open beaker is an example of an open system”.
Here the boundary is an imaginary surface
enclosing the beaker and reactants.

2. Closed System

In a closed system, there is no exchange of
matter, but exchange of energy is possible
between system and the surroundings
[Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a
closed vessel made of conducting material
e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed
system.

(b) Closed System

(c) Isolated System

Fig. 5.2 Open, closed and isolated systems.

* We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.

3. Isolated System

In an isolated system, there is no exchange
of energy or matter between the system and
the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence
of reactants in a thermos flask or any other
closed insulated vessel is an example of an
isolated system.

5.1.3 The State of the System

The system must be described in order to
make any useful calculations by specifying
quantitatively each of the properties such as
its pressure (p), volume (V), and temperature
(T) as well as the composition of the system.
We need to describe the system by specifying
it before and after the change. You would
recall from your Physics course that the
state of a system in mechanics is completely
specified at a given instant of time, by the
position and velocity of each mass point of
the system. In thermodynamics, a different
and much simpler concept of the state of a
system is introduced. It does not need detailed
knowledge of motion of each particle because,
we deal with average measurable properties of
the system. We specify the state of the system
by state functions or state variables.

The state of a thermodynamic system is
described by its measurable or macroscopic
(bulk) properties. We can describe the state
of a gas by quoting its pressure (p), volume
(V), temperature (T), amount (n) etc. Variables
like p, V, Tare called state variables or state
functions because their values depend only
on the state of the system and not on how it
is reached. In order to completely define the
state of a system it is not necessary to define
all the properties of the system; as only a
certain number of properties can be varied
independently. This number depends on the
nature of the system. Once these minimum
number of macroscopic properties are fixed,
others automatically have definite values.

The state of the surroundings can never
be completely specified; fortunately it is not
necessary to do so.

5.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State
Function

When we talk about our chemical system
losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce

CHEMISTRY

a quantity which represents the total energy
of the system. It may be chemical, electrical,
mechanical or any other type of energy you
may think of, the sum of all these is the energy
of the system. In thermodynamics, we call it
the internal energy, U of the system, which
may change, when

e heat passes into or out of the system,
e work is done on or by the system,
e matter enters or leaves the system.

These systems are classified accordingly
as you have already studied in section 5.1.2.

(a) Work

Let us first examine a change in internal energy
by doing work. We take a system containing
some quantity of water in a thermos flask
or in an insulated beaker. This would not
allow exchange of heat between the system
and surroundings through its boundary and
we call this type of system as adiabatic. The
manner in which the state of such a system
may be changed will be called adiabatic
process. Adiabatic process is a process in
which there is no transfer of heat between
the system and surroundings. Here, the wall
separating the system and the surroundings
is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3).

surroudings

Fig. 5.3 An adiabatic system which does not
permit the transfer of heat through its
boundary.

Let us bring the change in the internal
energy of the system by doing some work on
it. Let us call the initial state of the system
as state A and its temperature as T,. Let
the internal energy of the system in state A
be called U,. We can change the state of the
system in two different ways.

Reprint 2025-26

Unit 5.indd 139

THERMODYNAMICS

One way: We do some mechanical work, say
1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and
thereby churning water. Let the new state
be called B state and its temperature, as
T,. It is found that T,> T, and the change
in temperature, AT = T,-T,. Let the internal
energy of the system in state B be U, and the

change in internal energy, AU=U,- U,.

Second way: We now do an equal amount
(i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an
immersion rod and note down the temperature
change. We find that the change in temperature
is same as in the earlier case, say, T,,— T,.

In fact, the experiments in the above
manner were done by J. P. Joule between
1840-50 and he was able to show that a
given amount of work done on the system,
no matter how it was done (irrespective of
path) produced the same change of state, as
measured by the change in the temperature
of the system.

So, it seems appropriate to define a
quantity, the internal energy U, whose value
is characteristic of the state of a system,
whereby the adiabatic work, w,, required to
bring about a change of state is equal to the
difference between the value of Uin one state
and that in another state, AU Le.,

AU =U, -U,=w,,
Therefore, internal energy, U, of the
system is a state function.

By conventions of IUPAC in chemical
thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses
that w,, is positive when work is done on the
system and the internal energy of system
increases. Similarly, if the work is done by the
system, w,, will be negative because internal
energy of the system decreases.

Can you name some other familiar state
functions? Some of other familiar state
functions are V, p, and T. For example, if we
bring a change in temperature of the system
from 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature
is 35°C—25°C =+10°C, whether we go straight
up to 35°C or we cool the system for a few
degrees, then take the system to the final
temperature. Thus, Tis a state function and
the change in temperature is independent of

139

the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for
example, is a state function, because change
in volume of its water is independent of the
route by which water is filled in the pond,
either by rain or by tubewell or by both.

(b) Heat

We can also change the internal energy
of a system by transfer of heat from the
surroundings to the system or vice-versa
without expenditure of work. This exchange
of energy, which is a result of temperature
difference is called heat, gq. Let us consider
bringing about the same change in temperature
(the same initial and final states as before
in section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat
through thermally conducting walls instead
of adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4).

surroundings

&

matter

Fig. 5.4 A system which allows heat transfer
through its boundary.

We take water at temperature, T, in a
container having thermally conducting walls,
say made up of copper and enclose it in a
huge heat reservoir at temperature, T,. The
heat absorbed by the system (water), qcan be
measured in terms of temperature difference,
T, — T,. In this case change in internal energy,
AU = q, when no work is done at constant
volume.

By conventions of IUPAC in chemical
thermodynamics. The q is positive, when heat
is transferred from the surroundings to the
system and the internal energy of the system
increases and q is negative when heat is
transferred from system to the surroundings
resulting in decrease of the internal energy of
the system.

* Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the
system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.

(c) The general case

Let us consider the general case in which
a change of state is brought about both by
doing work and by transfer of heat. We write
change in internal energy for this case as:

AU=qtw (5.1)

For a given change in state, q and w can
vary depending on how the change is carried
out. However, gq +w = AU will depend only on
initial and final state. It will be independent
of the way the change is carried out. If there
is no transfer of energy as heat or as work
(isolated system) i.e., if w =O and q =O, then
AU=0.

The equation 5.1 i.e., AU = q+ wis
mathematical statement of the first law of
thermodynamics, which states that

The energy of an isolated system is
constant.

Itis commonly stated as the law of conservation
of energy i.e., energy can neither be created
nor be destroyed.

Note: There is considerable difference between
the character of the thermodynamic property
energy and that of a mechanical property such
as volume. We can specify an unambiguous
(absolute) value for volume of a system ina
particular state, but not the absolute value of
the internal energy. However, we can measure
only the changes in the internal energy, AU
of the system.

CHEMISTRY

5.2 APPLICATIONS

Many chemical reactions involve the generation
of gases capable of doing mechanical work or
the generation of heat. It is important for us
to quantify these changes and relate them
to the changes in the internal energy. Let us
see how!

5.2.1 Work

First of all, let us concentrate on the nature of
work a system can do. We will consider only
mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.

For understanding pressure-volume
work, let us consider a cylinder which
contains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with
a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas
is V, and pressure of the gas inside is p. If
external pressure is p,. which is greater than
—p, piston is moved inward till the pressure

inside becomes equal to p,,. Let this change
be achieved in a single step and the final
volume be V,. During this compression,
suppose piston moves a distance, / and
is cross-sectional area of the piston is A

then, volume change = 1x A= AV= (V,- V;)

Therefore, force on the piston = p,.. A

We also know, pressure =

If w is the work done on the system by
movement of the piston then

w = force x distance = p,.. A.l
= Pp.» (AV) =-p,, AV=—-p.(V,- V;) (5.2)
The negative sign of this expression is
required to obtain conventional sign for w,
which will be positive. It indicates that in case
of compression work is done on the system.
Here (V,— V,) will be negative and negative
multiplied by negative will be positive. Hence
the sign obtained for the work will be positive.

If the pressure is not constant at every
stage of compression, but changes in number
of finite steps, work done on the gas will be
summed over all the steps and will be equal
to — XUpAV [Fig. 5.5 (b)]

V, Volume (V)

Fig. 5.5 (b) pV-plot when pressure is not constant
and changes in finite steps during
compression from initial volume, V, to
final volume, V,. Work done on the gas
is represented by the shaded area.

141

If the pressure is not constant but
changes during the process such that it
is always infinitesimally greater than the
pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of
compression, the volume decreases by an
infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case we
can calculate the work done on the gas by the
relation

Vr
w=- | p..dV (5.3)
V;

Here, p,. at each stage is equal to (p,, + dp)
in case of compression [Fig. 5.5(c)]. In an
expansion process under similar conditions,
the external pressure is always less than the
pressure of the system i.e., p,. = (p,,- dp). In
general case we can write, p,. = (p,,+ dp). Such
processes are called reversible processes.

A process or change is said to be
reversible, ifa change is brought out in sucha
way that the process could, at any moment,
be reversed by an infinitesimal change.
A reversible process proceeds infinitely
slowly by a series of equilibrium states
such that system and the surroundings are
always in near equilibrium with each other.

142

Processes other than reversible processes
are known as irreversible processes.

In chemistry, we face problems that can
be solved if we relate the work term to the
internal pressure of the system. We can
relate work to internal pressure of the system
under reversible conditions by writing
equation 5.3 as follows:

Vp Vp
Wrev = ~ J P..AV =— J (Din t+dp)dV

Since dp x dVis very small we can write

Vr
Wrev = -| P»aV (5.4)

Now, the pressure of the gas (p,, which we
can write as p now) can be expressed in terms
of its volume through gas equation. For nmol

Free expansion: Expansion of a gas in
vacuum (p,, = 0) is called free expansion.
No work is done during free expansion of an
ideal gas whether the process is reversible or
irreversible (equation 5.2 and 5.3).

Now, we can write equation 5.1 in number
of ways depending on the type of processes.
Let us substitute w = — p, AV (eq. 5.2) in
equation 5.1, and we get
AU = q- Dex AV

If a process is carried out at constant volume
(AV = O), then
AU=4q,

the subscript v in q,denotes that heat is
supplied at constant volume.

5.2.2 Enthalpy, H
(a) A Useful New State Function

We know that the heat absorbed at constant
volume is equal to change in the internal
energy i.e., AU = q,. But most of chemical
reactions are carried out not at constant
volume, but in flasks or test tubes under
constant atmospheric pressure. We need to
define another state function which may be
suitable under these conditions.

We may write equation (5.1) as
AU = q — pAV at constant pressure, where
q, is heat absorbed by the system and —pAV
represent expansion work done by the system.

Let us represent the initial state by
subscript 1 and final state by 2

We can rewrite the above equation as
U,-U, = q,— P (V, ~ V,)

On rearranging, we get

q, = (U, + pV.) — (U, + pV,) (S.6)
Now we can define another thermodynamic

function, the enthalpy H [Greek word
enthalpien, to warm or heat content] as :

H=U+ pv (5.7)

so, equation (5.6) becomes

q,= H,- H, = AH

Although qis a path dependent function,
His a state function because it depends on
U, p and V, all of which are state functions.
Therefore, AH is independent of path. Hence,
q, is also independent of path.

For finite changes at constant pressure,
we can write equation 5.7 as

AH = AU + ApV

Since pis constant, we can write

AH = AU + pAV (5.8)

It is important to note that when heat is
absorbed by the system at constant pressure,
we are actually measuring changes in the
enthalpy.

143

Remember AH = q,, heat absorbed by the
system at constant pressure.

AH is negative for exothermic reactions
which evolve heat during the reaction and
AH is positive for endothermic reactions
which absorb heat from the surroundings.

At constant volume (AV = 0), AU = q,,
therefore equation 5.8 becomes

AH = AU=q,

The difference between AH and AUis not
usually significant for systems consisting
of only solids and / or liquids. Solids and
liquids do not suffer any significant volume
changes upon heating. The difference,
however, becomes significant when gases are
involved. Let us consider a reaction involving
gases. If V, is the total volume of the gaseous
reactants, V, is the total volume of the gaseous
products, n, is the number of moles of gaseous
reactants and n, is the number of moles of
gaseous products, all at constant pressure
and temperature, then using the ideal gas
law, we write,

pV, = n,RT

A

and pV, = NgRT

B
Thus, pV,- pV, = n,RT-n,RT = (n,-n,)RT
or P(V,— V,) = (ng - nN) RT

or pAV=AnRT (5.9)

Here, An, refers to the number of moles of
gaseous products minus the number of moles
of gaseous reactants.

Substituting the value of pAV from
equation 5.9 in equation 5.8, we get
AH = AU + An. RT (5.10)

The equation 5.10 is useful for calculating
AH from AU and vice versa.

Problem 5.5

perfect gas, molar enthalpy change for
vapourisation of 1 mol of water at lbar

pressure and 100°C.

Solution
(i) The change H,O (1) — H,O (g)
AH = AU + AngRT

or AU = AH- An RT, substituting the
values, we get

AU = 41.00 kJ mol! - 1

x 8.3 J mol! K! x 373 K
= 41.00 kJ mol! - 3.096 kJ mol!
= 37.904 kJ mol!

(b) Extensive and Intensive Properties

In thermodynamics, a distinction is made
between extensive properties and intensive
properties. An extensive property is a
property whose value depends on the quantity
or size of matter present in the system. For
example, mass, volume, internal energy,
enthalpy, heat capacity, etc. are extensive
properties.

Those properties which do not depend
on the quantity or size of matter present
are known as intensive properties. For
example temperature, density, pressure etc.
are intensive properties. A molar property,
Xm» 1S the value of an extensive property x of
the system for 1 mol of the substance. If nis

the amount of matter, %m = n is independent
of the amount of matter. Other examples are
molar volume, V, and molar heat capacity,
C,. Let us understand the distinction
between extensive and intensive properties by
considering a gas enclosed in a container of
volume V and at temperature T [Fig. 5.6(a)].
Let us make a partition such that volume
is halved, each part [Fig. 5.6 (b)] now has

one half of the original volume, > but the

temperature will still remain the same i-.e., T.
It is clear that volume is an extensive property
and temperature is an intensive property.

CHEMISTRY

Fig. 5.6 (b) Partition, each part having half the
volume of the gas

(c) Heat Capacity

In this sub-section, let us see how to measure
heat transferred to a system. This heat
appears as arise in temperature of the system
in case of heat absorbed by the system.

The increase of temperature is proportional
to the heat transferred

q = coeff x AT

The magnitude of the coefficient depends
on the size, composition and nature of the
system. We can also write it as g = CAT

The coefficient, C is called the heat
capacity.

Thus, we can measure the heat supplied
by monitoring the temperature rise, provided
we know the heat capacity.

When C is large, a given amount of heat
results in only a small temperature rise. Water
has a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy
is needed to raise its temperature.

C is directly proportional to amount of
substance. The molar heat capacity of a

substance, C, = (<). is the heat capacity

n

for one mole of the substance and is
the quantity of heat needed to raise the
temperature of one mole by one degree
celsius (or one kelvin). Specific heat, also
called specific heat capacity is the quantity

Unit 5.indd 145

THERMODYNAMICS

of heat required to raise the temperature of
one unit mass of a substance by one degree
celsius (or one kelvin). For finding out the
heat, g, required to raise the temperatures
of a sample, we multiply the specific heat
of the substance, c, by the mass m, and
temperatures change, AT as

q=cxmxAT =CAT (5.11)
(d) The Relationship between Cc, and C,

for an Ideal Gas

At constant volume, the heat capacity, C is
denoted by C,, and at constant pressure, this
is denoted by C,. Let us find the relationship
between the two.

We can write equation for heat, q
at constant volume as q, = CyAT = AU
at constant pressure as q,= C,AT = AH

The difference between C, and C, can be
derived for an ideal gas as:
For a mole of an ideal gas, AH = AU + A(pV)
= AU+ A(RT)

= AU+ RAT
-- AH = AU+RAT (5.12)

On putting the values of AH and AU,
we have

C,AT = C,AT + RAT

C,=Cy+R
C,-C,=R (5.13)
5.3 MEASUREMENT OF AU AND AH:
CALORIMETRY

We can measure energy changes associated
with chemical or physical processes by an
experimental technique called calorimetry.
In calorimetry, the process is carried out ina
vessel called calorimeter, which is immersed
in a known volume of a liquid. Knowing
the heat capacity of the liquid in which
calorimeter is immersed and the heat capacity
of calorimeter, it is possible to determine the
heat evolved in the process by measuring
temperature changes. Measurements are
made under two different conditions:

145

i) at constant volume, q,

ii) at constant pressure, q,

(a) AU Measurements

For chemical reactions, heat absorbed at
constant volume, is measured in a bomb
calorimeter (Fig. 5.7). Here, a steel vessel (the
bomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole
device is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is
immersed in water bath to ensure that no heat
is lost to the surroundings. A combustible

substance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied
in the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the
reaction is transferred to the water around the
bomb and its temperature is monitored. Since
the bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume
does not change i.e., the energy changes
associated with reactions are measured at
constant volume. Under these conditions, no
work is done as the reaction is carried out
at constant volume in the bomb calorimeter.
Even for reactions involving gases, there is no
work done as AV= 0. Temperature change of
the calorimeter produced by the completed
reaction is then converted to q,, by using the
known heat capacity of the calorimeter with
the help of equation 5.11.

(B) AH Measurements

Measurement of heat change at constant
pressure (generally under atmospheric pressure)
can be done in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 5.8.
We know that AH = q, (at constant p) and,
therefore, heat absorbed or evolved, q, at
constant pressure is also called the heat of
reaction or enthalpy of reaction, AH.

In an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved,
and system loses heat to the surroundings.
Therefore, q, will be negative and A.H will
also be negative. Similarly in an endothermic
reaction, heat is absorbed, q, is positive and
A H will be positive.

of the bomb calorimeter is 20.7kJ/K,
what is the enthalpy change for the above
reaction at 298 K and 1 atm?

Solution

Suppose g is the quantity of heat from
the reaction mixture and C, is the
heat capacity of the calorimeter, then
the quantity of heat absorbed by the
calorimeter.

q= C,x AT

Quantity of heat from the reaction will
have the same magnitude but opposite
sign because the heat lost by the system
(reaction mixture) is equal to the heat
gained by the calorimeter.

q=-C,x AT=- 20.7 kJ/K x (299 - 298) K
= — 20.7 kJ

exothermic nature of the reaction)

= [H,, (CO,, g) + 2H, (H,O, )]- [H,, (CH,, g)

+ 2H, (O,, g)]
where H_, is the molar enthalpy.

Enthalpy change is a very useful quantity.
Knowledge of this quantity is required when
one needs to plan the heating or cooling
required to maintain an industrial chemical
reaction at constant temperature. It is also
required to calculate temperature dependence
of equilibrium constant.

(a) Standard Enthalpy of Reactions

Enthalpy of a reaction depends on the
conditions under which a reaction is carried
out. It is, therefore, necessary that we
must specify some standard conditions.
The standard enthalpy of reaction is the
enthalpy change for a reaction when all
the participating substances are in their
standard states.

The standard state of a substance at a
specified temperature is its pure form at
1 bar. For example, the standard state of liquid

147

ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at
1 bar; standard state of solid iron at 500 K
is pure iron at 1 bar. Usually data are taken
at 298 K.

Standard conditions are denoted by
adding the superscript © to the symbol AH,
e.g., AH®

(b) Enthalpy Changes
Transformations

during Phase

Phase transformations also involve energy
changes. Ice, for example, requires heat for
melting. Normally this melting takes place at
constant pressure (atmospheric pressure) and
during phase change, temperature remains
constant (at 273 K).

H,O(s) > H,O(); A,,.H°= 6.00 kJ moI™

Here A, .H® is enthalpy of fusion in standard
state. If water freezes, then process is reversed

and equal amount of heat is given off to the
surroundings.

The enthalpy change that accompanies
melting of one mole of a solid substance in
standard state is called standard enthalpy
of fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion,
Agus”.

Melting of a solid is endothermic, so
all enthalpies of fusion are positive. Water

temperature of its boiling point T, and at
constant pressure:

H,O() > H,O(g); A,,,H° = + 40.79 kJ mol!
A apt? is the standard enthalpy of vaporisation.

Amount of heat required to vaporize one
mole of a liquid at constant temperature
and under standard pressure (1bar) is called
its standard enthalpy of vaporization or
molar enthalpy of vaporization, A, ,H”.

Sublimation is direct conversion of a
solid into its vapour. Solid CO, or ‘dry ice’
sublimes at 195K with A, ,H°=25.2 kJ mol";

naphthalene sublimes slowly and for this
A, He = 73.0 kJ mol” .

Standard enthalpy of sublimation,
A,,, is the change in enthalpy when one
mole of a solid substance sublimes at a
constant temperature and under standard

pressure (1bar).

The magnitude of the enthalpy change
depends on the strength of the intermolecular
interactions in the substance undergoing
the phase transfomations. For example,
the strong hydrogen bonds between water
molecules hold them tightly in liquid phase.
For an organic liquid, such as acetone, the
intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions are
significantly weaker. Thus, it requires less
heat to vaporise 1 mol of acetone than it does
to vaporize 1 mol of water. Table 5.1 gives
values of standard enthalpy changes of fusion
and vaporisation for some substances.

A,H? = -74.81 kJ mot!

2C (graphite, s)+3H, (g)+ 20,(g) ~ C,H,OH(1);
A,H® = — 277.7kJ mol

It is important to understand that a
standard molar enthalpy of formation, A At ®,
is just a special case of A H°, where one mole
of a compound is formed from its constituent
elements, as in the above three equations,
where 1 mol of each, water, methane and
ethanol is formed. In contrast, the enthalpy
change for an exothermic reaction:

CaO(s) + CO,(g) > CaCo,(s);
A H°= — 178.3kJ mol*

is not an enthalpy of formation of calcium
carbonate, since calcium carbonate has been
formed from other compounds, and not from
its constituent elements. Also, for the reaction
given below, enthalpy change is not standard
enthalpy of formation, A H® for HBr(g).

H,(g) + Br,() > 2HBr(g);
A H®= - 178.3kJ mol

Here two moles, instead of one mole of the
product is formed from the elements, i.e.,

A, H®°= 2A,He

Therefore, by dividing all coefficients in
the balanced equation by 2, expression for
enthalpy of formation of HBr (g) is written as
’AH,(g) + 2Br,(1) — HBr(g);

A,H°= — 36.4 kJ mol!

Standard enthalpies of formation of some
common substances are given in Table 5.2.

By convention, standard enthalpy for
formation, A,H®, of an element in reference
state, i.e., its most stable state of aggregation
is taken as zero.

Suppose, you are a chemical engineer and
want to know how much heat is required to
decompose calcium carbonate to lime and
carbon dioxide, with all the substances in
their standard state.

CaCO,(s) > CaO(s) + CO,(g); A, H® = ?

CHEMISTRY

Here, we can make use of standard enthalpy
of formation and calculate the enthalpy
change for the reaction. The following general
equation can be used for the enthalpy change
calculation.

A FP= >) a,A,HP (products)— >' b,A,HP (reactants)
(5.15)
where a and b represent the coefficients of
the products and reactants in the balanced
equation. Let us apply the above equation for
decomposition of calcium carbonate. Here,
coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ are 1 each. Therefore,
A H°= A,H®= [CaO(s)]+ A,H°[CO,(g)]
— A,H°= [CaCO.,(s)]
=1 (-635.1 kJ mol?) + 1(-393.5 kJ mol)
—1(-1206.9 kJ mol")
= 178.3 kJ mol!

Thus, the decomposition of CaCO, (s) is
an endothermic process and you have to heat
it for getting the desired products.

(a) Thermochemical Equations
A balanced chemical equation together with
the value ofits A_H is called a thermochemical
equation. We specify the physical state
(alongwith allotropic state) of the substance
in an equation. For example:
C,H,OH(J + 30,(g) > 2CO,(g) + 3H,O();

A H°=— 1367 kJ mol*

The above equation describes the
combustion of liquid ethanol at constant
temperature and pressure. The negative sign
of enthalpy change indicates that this is an
exothermic reaction.

It would be necessary to remember the
following conventions regarding thermo-
chemical equations.

1. The coefficients in a balanced thermo-
chemical equation refer to the number of
moles (never molecules) of reactants and
products involved in the reaction.

2. The numerical value of A.H® refers to the
number of moles of substances specified
by an equation. Standard enthalpy change
A. will have units as kJ mol”.

THERMODYNAMICS

To illustrate the concept, let us consider
the calculation of heat of reaction for the
following reaction :

Fe,O, (s)+ 3H, (g) > 2Fe(s)+ 3H,O(I),
From the Table (5.2) of standard enthalpy of
formation (A T°), we find :
AAP (H,O0,) = -285.83 kJ mol”;
AAP (Fe,O,,s) = — 824.2 kJ mol’;
Also AAP (Fe, s) = 0 and

AHP (H,, g) = 0 as per convention
Then,
AH? = 3(-285.83 kJ mol")

— 1(-- 824.2 kJ mot’)
= (-857.5 + 824.2) kJ mol!
= -33.3 kJ mol"

Note that the coefficients used in these
calculations are pure numbers, which
are equal to the respective stoichiometric
coefficients. The unit for A H® is
kJ mol', which means per mole of reaction.
Once we balance the chemical equation in a
particular way, as above, this defines the mole
of reaction. If we had balanced the equation
differently, for example,

5 Fe.0, (s)+ SH, (g) > Fe(s)+ = H,0 (I)

then this amount of reaction would be one
mole of reaction and A,H° would be

AH? = 3 (285.83 kJ mot’)

- 5 (824.2 kJ mol")

= (- 428.7 + 412.1) kJ mot!
=-16.6 kJ mol’= “2A H?°
It shows that enthalpy is an extensive
quantity.
3. When a chemical equation is reversed,

the value of A,H° is reversed in sign. For
example

N,(g) + 3H, (g) > 2NH, (g);

A, H°=-91.8 kJ. mol!
2NH,(g) > N,(g) + 3H, (g);

A, H°= + 91.8 kJ mol*

(e) Hess’s Law Heat

Summation

of Constant

We know that enthalpy is a state function,
therefore the change in enthalpy is independent
of the path between initial state (reactants)
and final state (products). In other words,
enthalpy change for a reaction is the same
whether it occurs in one step or in a series
of steps. This may be stated as follows in the
form of Hess’s Law.

If a reaction takes place in several
steps then its standard reaction enthalpy
is the sum of the standard enthalpies of
the intermediate reactions into which the
overall reaction may be divided at the same
temperature.

Let us understand the importance of this
law with the help of an example.

Consider the enthalpy change for the
reaction
C (graphite,s) +0, (g) > CO (g); A, H°= ?

Although CO(g) is the major product, some
CO, gas is always produced in this reaction.
Therefore, we cannot measure enthalpy
change for the above reaction directly.
However, if we can find some other reactions
involving related species, it is possible to
calculate the enthalpy change for the above
reaction.

Let us consider the following reactions:
C (graphite,s) + O, (g) > CO, (g);

A H°=~— 393.5 kJ mol” (i)

1
CO (g) + 52% (8) > CO, (8)
A_H°=— 283.0 kJ mol” (ii)
We can combine the above two reactions
in such a way so as to obtain the desired
reaction. To get one mole of CO(g) on the
right, we reverse equation (ii). In this, heat
is absorbed instead of being released, so we
change sign of A .H® value

1
CO, (g) > CO (g) +> O, (g);
A H®= + 283.0 kJ mo!" (iii)

Reprint 2025-26

Adding equation (i) and (iii), we get the
desired equation,

C(graphite, s) + 502 (g) > CO(g);

for which A, H® = (— 393.5 + 283.0)
=- 110.5 kJ mol!

5.5 ENTHALPIES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES
OF REACTIONS

It is convenient to give name to enthalpies
specifying the types of reactions.

(a) Standard Enthalpy of Combustion
(symbol : A.H°)

Combustion reactions are exothermic in
nature. These are important in industry,
rocketry, and other walks of life. Standard
enthalpy of combustion is defined as the
enthalpy change per mole (or per unit amount)
of a substance, when it undergoes combustion
and all the reactants and products being
in their standard states at the specified
temperature.

Cooking gas in cylinders contains mostly
butane (C,H,,). During complete combustion
of one mole of butane, 2658 kJ of heat is
released. We can write the thermochemical
reactions for this as:

13
C,H,o(g) + ry O,(g) — 4CO,(g) + 5H,O(0);

A. H® = - 2658.0 kJ mol"

CHEMISTRY

Similarly, combustion of glucose gives out
2802.0 kJ/mol of heat, for which the overall
equation is :

C,H,.0,(g) + 60,(g) — 6CO,(g) + 6H,O(1);
A. H® = —- 2802.0 kJ mol?

Our body also generates energy from food
by the same overall process as combustion,
although the final products are produced after

a series of complex bio-chemical reactions
involving enzymes.

THERMODYNAMICS

(b) Enthalpy of Atomization

(symbol: A H°)
Consider the following example of atomization
of dihydrogen

H,(g) > 2H(g); A,H®° = 435.0 kJ mol"

You can see that H atoms are formed by
breaking H-H bonds in dihydrogen. The
enthalpy change in this process is known
as enthalpy of atomization, A,H®%. It is the
enthalpy change on breaking one mole of
bonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas
phase.

In case of diatomic molecules, like
dihydrogen (given above), the enthalpy of
atomization is also the bond dissociation
enthalpy. The other examples of enthalpy of
atomization can be

CH,(g) > C(g) + 4H(g); A,H° = 1665 kJ mol"
Note that the products are only atoms of C

and H in gaseous phase. Now see the following
reaction:

Na(s) > Na(g); A,H® = 108.4 kJ mol

153

In this case, the enthalpy of atomization is
same as the enthalpy of sublimation.

(c) Bond Enthalpy (symbol: A, ,H°)

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and
making of chemical bonds. Energy is required
to break a bond and energy is released when a
bond is formed. It is possible to relate heat of
reaction to changes in energy associated with
breaking and making of chemical bonds. With
reference to the enthalpy changes associated
with chemical bonds, two different terms are
used in thermodynamics.

(i) Bond dissociation enthalpy
(ii) Mean bond enthalpy

Let us discuss these terms with reference
to diatomic and polyatomic molecules.

Diatomic Molecules: Consider the following
process in which the bonds in one mole of
dihydrogen gas (H,) are broken:

H,(g) > 2H(g); A, ,H° = 435.0 kJ mol"

The enthalpy change involved in this process
is the bond dissociation enthalpy of H-H
bond. The bond dissociation enthalpy is the
change in enthalpy when one mole of covalent
bonds of a gaseous covalent compound is
broken to form products in the gas phase.

Note that it is the same as the enthalpy of
atomization of dihydrogen. This is true for all
diatomic molecules. For example:

Cl (g) > 2Cl(g); Ay gH? = 242 kJ mol!

CI-CI
O,(g) > 20(g); Ao.oH® = 428 kJ mol
In the case of polyatomic molecules, bond

dissociation enthalpy is different for different
bonds within the same molecule.
Polyatomic Molecules: Let us now consider
a polyatomic molecule like methane, CH,.
The overall thermochemical equation for its
atomization reaction is given below:

CH, (g) > C(g) + 4H(g);

A, H® = 1665 kJ mol"

In methane, all the four C — H bonds are
identical in bond length and energy. However,
the energies required to break the individual
C -—H bonds in each successive step differ :

CH,(g) > CH,(g)+H(g);A
CH,(g) > CH,(g)+H(g);A
CH,(g) > CH(g)+H(g);A
CH(g) > C(g)+H(g);A
Therefore,

CH,(g) — C(g)+4H(g);A, H°= 1665 kJ mol!

In such cases we use mean bond enthalpy
of C - H bond.
For example in CH,, A, ,,H® is calculated as:
Ag yH? = 4 (A, H®) = % (1665 kJ mol")

= 416 kJ mol!

We find that mean C-H bond enthalpy
in methane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been
found that mean C-H bond enthalpies differ
slightly from compound to compound, as
in CH,CH,Cl, CH,NO,, etc., but it does not
differ in a great deal*. Using Hess’s law, bond
enthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy
values of some single and multiple bonds are

bond

CHEMISTRY

given in Table 5.3. The reaction enthalpies are
very important quantities as these arise from
the changes that accompany the breaking of
old bonds and formation of the new bonds.
We can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas
phase, if we know different bond enthalpies.
The standard enthalpy of reaction, A.H® is
related to bond enthalpies of the reactants
and products in gas phase reactions as:

AEP = >’ bond enthalpies, .acianis
-}' bond enthalpies

products

(5.17)**

This relationship is particularly more
useful when the required values of A,H® are
not available. The net enthalpy change of a
reaction is the amount of energy required
to break all the bonds in the reactant
molecules minus the amount of energy
required to break all the bonds in the product
molecules. Remember that this relationship is
approximate and is valid when all substances

The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied

by very little heat change.

(e) Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : A_,,H°)

Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the
enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves
in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy
of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy
change observed on dissolving the substance
in an infinite amount of solvent when the
interactions between the ions (or solute
molecules) are negligible.

When an ionic compound dissolves in a
solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions
on the crystal lattice. These are now more free in
solution. But solvation of these ions (hydration
in case solvent is water) also occurs at the
same time. This is shown diagrammatically,
for an ionic compound, AB (s)

AB (s) Aw A‘(aq) + B (aq)

i) (=)
MratticeET Anyald

A'(g) + B(g)

CHEMISTRY

The enthalpy of solution of AB(s), A, ,H°,
in water is, therefore, determined by the
selective values of the lattice enthalpy, A, _. H®

lattice

and enthalpy of hydration of ions, A,,,H° as

Ao Ho = AtatticeHl ° + ApyaEt ©

For most of the ionic compounds, A,,
H® is positive and the dissociation process
is endothermic. Therefore the solubility of
most salts in water increases with rise of
temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very
high, the dissolution of the compound may
not take place at all. Why do many fluorides
tend to be less soluble than the corresponding
chlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of
enthalpy changes may be made by using
tables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice
energies (enthalpies).
() -Enthalpy of Dilution

It is known that enthalpy of solution is the
enthalpy change associated with the addition
of a specified amount of solute to the specified
amount of solvent at a constant temperature
and pressure. This argument can be applied
to any solvent with slight modification.
Enthalpy change for dissolving one mole of
gaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water
can be represented by the following equation.
For convenience we will use the symbol aq.
for water

HCl(g) + 10 aq. — HC1.10 aq.
AH = -69.01 kJ / mol

Let us consider the following set of
enthalpy changes:

(S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. — HC1.25 aq.
AH = -72.03 kJ / mol

(S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. — HC1.40 aq.

AH = -72.79 kJ / mol
(S-3) HCl(g) + c% aq. — HCl. ~ aq.

AH = -74.85 kJ / mol

The values of AH show general dependence
of the enthalpy of solution on amount of
solvent. As more and more solvent is used,
the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting
value, i.e, the value in infinitely dilute
solution. For hydrochloric acid this value of
AH is given above in equation (S-3).

THERMODYNAMICS

If we subtract the first equation (equation
S-1) from the second equation (equation S-2)
in the above set of equations, we obtain-

HCl1.25 aq. + 15 aq. — HCL1.40 aq.
AH = [ -72.79 — (-72.03)] kJ / mol

=- 0.76 kJ / mol

This value (-O.76kJ/mol) of AH is enthalpy
of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from
the surroundings when additional solvent is
added to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution
of a solution is dependent on the original
concentration of the solution and the amount
of solvent added.

5.6 SPONTANEITY

The first law of thermodynamics tells us
about the relationship between the heat
absorbed and the work performed on or
by a system. It puts no restrictions on
the direction of heat flow. However, the
flow of heat is unidirectional from higher
temperature to lower temperature. In fact,
all naturally occurring processes whether
chemical or physical will tend to proceed
spontaneously in one direction only. For
example, a gas expanding to fill the available
volume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving
carbon dioxide.

But heat will not flow from colder body to
warmer body on its own, the gas in a container
will not spontaneously contract into one
corner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon
and dioxygen spontaneously. These and many
other spontaneously occurring changes show
unidirectional change. We may ask ‘what is
the driving force of spontaneously occurring
changes ? What determines the direction of a
spontaneous change ? In this section, we shall
establish some criterion for these processes
whether these will take place or not.

Let us first understand what do we mean
by spontaneous reaction or change ? You
may think by your common observation that
spontaneous reaction is one which occurs
immediately when contact is made between
the reactants. Take the case of combination
of hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may
be mixed at room temperature and left for

157

many years without observing any perceptible
change. Although the reaction is taking place
between them, it is at an extremely slow
rate. It is still called spontaneous reaction.
So spontaneity means ‘having the potential
to proceed without the assistance of external
agency’. However, it does not tell about the
rate of the reaction or process. Another aspect
of spontaneous reaction or process, as we see
is that these cannot reverse their direction on
their own. We may summarise it as follows:

A spontaneous process is an
irreversible process and may only be
reversed by some external agency.

(a) Is Decrease in Enthalpy a. Criterion
for Spontaneity ?
If we examine the phenomenon like flow of
water down hill or fall of a stone on to the
ground, we find that there is a net decrease
in potential energy in the direction of change.
By analogy, we may be tempted to state that
a chemical reaction is spontaneous in a
given direction, because decrease in energy
has taken place, as in the case of exothermic
reactions. For example:

1
A. H° =—- 46.1 kJ mol"

1 1
3 Hal) + 5 Chale) = HCl (e)
A, H® = — 92.32 kJ mol™
1
2 A H® = -285.8 kJ mol
The decrease in enthalpy in passing from
reactants to products may be shown for any

exothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram
as shown in Fig. 5.10(a).

Thus, the postulate that driving force for
a chemical reaction may be due to decrease
in energy sounds ‘reasonable’ as the basis of
evidence so far !

Now let us examine the following reactions:
1
A, He = +33.2 kJ mol™

C(graphite, s) + 2 S(l) — CS,(l);
A, He = +128.5 kJ mol

Therefore, it becomes obvious that while
decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory
factor for spontaneity, but it is not true for
all cases.

(b) Entropy and Spontaneity

Then, what drives the spontaneous process
in a given direction ? Let us examine sucha
case in which AH= 0i.e., there is no change in
enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.

Let us consider diffusion of two gases
into each other in a closed container which
is isolated from the surroundings as shown
in Fig. 5.11.

The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are
represented by black dots and white dots

CHEMISTRY

(b)
Fig. 5.11 Diffusion of two gases

respectively and separated by a movable
partition [Fig. 5.11 (a)]. When the partition is
withdrawn |Fig. 5.11(b)], the gases begin to
diffuse into each other and after a period of
time, diffusion will be complete.

Let us examine the process. Before
partition, if we were to pick up the gas
molecules from left container, we would be
sure that these will be molecules of gas A
and similarly if we were to pick up the gas
molecules from right container, we would
be sure that these will be molecules of gas
B. But, if we were to pick up molecules from
container when partition is removed, we are
not sure whether the molecules picked are of
gas A or gas B. We say that the system has
become less predictable or more chaotic.

We may now formulate another postulate:
in an isolated system, there is always a
tendency for the systems’ energy to become
more disordered or chaotic and this could be
a criterion for spontaneous change !

At this point, we introduce another
thermodynamic function, entropy denoted
as S. The above mentioned disorder is the
manifestation of entropy. To form a mental

THERMODYNAMICS

picture, one can think of entropy as a measure
of the degree of randomness or disorder in the
system. The greater the disorder in an isolated
system, the higher is the entropy. As far asa
chemical reaction is concerned, this entropy
change can be attributed to rearrangement of
atoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants
to another (in the products). If the structure
of the products is very much disordered than
that of the reactants, there will be a resultant
increase in entropy. The change in entropy
accompanying a chemical reaction may be
estimated qualitatively by a consideration of
the structures of the species taking part in the
reaction. Decrease of regularity in structure
would mean increase in entropy. For a given
substance, the crystalline solid state is the
state of lowest entropy (most ordered), The
gaseous state is state of highest entropy.

Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way
to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic
distribution of energy among molecules
would be through statistical method which
is beyond the scope of this treatment. Other
way would be to relate this process to the
heat involved in a process which would make
entropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy,
like any other thermodynamic property such
as internal energy Uand enthalpy His a state
function and AS is independent of path.

Whenever heat is added to the system,
it increases molecular motions causing
increased randomness in the system. Thus
heat (q) has randomising influence on the
system. Can we then equate AS with gq? Wait !
Experience suggests us that the distribution
of heat also depends on the temperature at
which heat is added to the system. A system at
higher temperature has greater randomness
in itthan one at lower temperature. Thus,
temperature is the measure of average
chaotic motion of particles in the system.
Heat added to a system at lower temperature
causes greater randomness than when the
same quantity of heat is added to it at higher
temperature. This suggests that the entropy
change is inversely proportional to the
temperature. AS is related with g and T fora
reversible reaction as :

159

AS = drew (5.18)
T

The total entropy change (AS,,) for the
system and surroundings of a spontaneous
process is given by

AS tai = AS. + AS,,,,, > O

system surr

(5.19)

When a system is in equilibrium, the
entropy is maximum, and the change in
entropy, AS = 0.

We can say that entropy for a spontaneous
process increases till it reaches maximum
and at equilibrium the change in entropy is
zero. Since entropy is a state property, we can
calculate the change in entropy of a reversible
process by

Asys,rev
AS. = T

We find that both for reversible and
irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under
isothermal conditions, AU = 0, but AS,

i.e., AS,,, + AS,,,,is not zero for irreversible
process. Thus, AU does not discriminate
between reversible and irreversible process,
whereas AS does.

in the lattice and system becomes
more disordered, therefore entropy
increases.

(iii) Reactant, NaHCO, is a solid and it
has low entropy. Among products
there are one solid and two gases.
Therefore, the products represent a
condition of higher entropy.

(iv) Here one molecule gives two atoms

This shows that the above reaction is
spontaneous.

(c) Gibbs Energy and Spontaneity

We have seen that for a system, it is the
total entropy change, AS,,,,, which decides
the spontaneity of the process. But most of
the chemical reactions fall into the category
of either closed systems or open systems.
Therefore, for most of the chemical reactions
there are changes in both enthalpy and
entropy. It is clear from the discussion in
previous sections that neither decrease in
enthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can
determine the direction of spontaneous
change for these systems.

For this purpose, we define a new
thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy
or Gibbs function, G, as

G=H-TS (5.20)
Gibbs function, Gis an extensive property
and a state function.

The change in Gibbs energy for the
system, AG,,, can be written as

AGgys = AH sys — TAS sy5 — SgysAT

sys sys Sys Sys

At constant temperature, AT =0
“ AGg,, = AHg,, — TAS

sys sys sys

Usually the subscript ‘system’ is dropped

and we simply write this equation as
AG = AH - TAS (5.21)

Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy
change — temperature x entropy change, and
is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of
the most important equations in chemistry.
Here, we have considered both terms together
for spontaneity: energy (in terms of AH)
and entropy (AS, a measure of disorder) as
indicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse,
we find that AG has units of energy because,
both AH and the TAS are energy terms, since
TAS = (K) (J/K) = J.

Now let us consider how AG is related to
reaction spontaneity.

We know,

total = AS ois + AS curr

If the system is in thermal equilibrium with
the surrounding, then the temperature of the
surrounding is same as that of the system.
Also, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding
is equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the
system.

Using equation 5.21, the above equation can
be written as

AG = AH -TAS <0 (5.22)

AH,, ,is the enthalpy change ofa reaction,
TAS.,,is the energy which is not available to do
useful work. So AGis the net energy available
to do useful work and is thus a measure of the
‘free energy’. For this reason, it is also known
as the free energy of the reaction.

AG gives a criteria for spontaneity at
constant pressure and temperature.

(i) If AGis negative (< 0), the process is
spontaneous.

(ii) If AGis positive (> 0), the process is non
spontaneous.
Note : If a reaction has a positive enthalpy
change and positive entropy change, it can
be spontaneous when TAS is large enough to
outweigh AH. This can happen in two ways;
(a) The positive entropy change of the system
can be ‘small’ in which case T must be
large. (b) The positive entropy change of the
system can be ‘large’, in which case T may

161

be small. The former is one of the reasons
why reactions are often carried out at high
temperature. Table 5.4 summarises the effect
of temperature on spontaneity of reactions.

(d) Entropy and Second Law of
Thermodynamics

We know that for an isolated system
the change in energy remains constant.
Therefore, increase in entropy in such
systems is the natural direction of a
spontaneous change. This, in fact is the
second law of thermodynamics. Like first
law of thermodynamics, second law can also
be stated in several ways. The second law of
thermodynamics explains why spontaneous
exothermic reactions are so common.
In exothermic reactions heat released
by the reaction increases the disorder
of the surroundings and overall entropy
change is positive which makes the reaction
spontaneous.

(e) Absolute Entropy and Third Law of
Thermodynamics

Molecules of a substance may move in a
straight line in any direction, they may
spin like a top and the bonds in the
molecules may stretch and compress.
These motions of the molecule are called
translational, rotational and vibrational
motion respectively. When temperature of
the system rises, these motions become
more vigorous and entropy increases. On the
other hand when temperature is lowered, the
entropy decreases. The entropy of any pure
crystalline substance approaches zero as
the temperature approaches absolute zero.
This is called third law of thermodynamics.
This is so because there is perfect order in
a crystal at absolute zero. The statement is
confined to pure crystalline solids because
theoretical arguments and practical evidences
have shown that entropy of solutions and
super cooled liquids is not zero at O K. The
importance of the third law lies in the fact that
it permits the calculation of absolute values
of entropy of pure substance from thermal
data alone. For a pure substance, this can

increments from O

be done by summing “het
K to 298 K. Standard entropies can be used
to calculate standard entropy changes by a

Hess’s law type of calculation.

5.7 GIBBS ENERGY CHANGE AND
EQUILIBRIUM

We have seen how a knowledge of the sign
and magnitude of the free energy change of a
chemical reaction allows:

(i) Prediction of the spontaneity of the
chemical reaction.

(ii) Prediction of the useful work that could
be extracted from it.

So far we have considered free energy
changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now
examine the free energy changes in reversible
reactions.

‘Reversible’ under strict thermodynamic
sense is a special way of carrying out
a process such that system is at all
times in perfect equilibrium with its
surroundings. When applied to a chemical
reaction, the term ‘reversible’ indicates
that a given reaction can proceed in either
direction simultaneously, so that a dynamic
equilibrium is set up. This means that the
reactions in both the directions should
proceed with a decrease in free energy, which
seems impossible. It is possible only if at
equilibrium the free energy of the system

CHEMISTRY

is minimum. If it is not, the system would
spontaneously change to configuration of
lower free energy.

So, the criterion for equilibrium

A+B2=C+D; is

AG=0

Gibbs energy for a reaction in which all
reactants and products are in standard state,
A,G° is related to the equilibrium constant of
the reaction as follows:

0 =AG°+RTINnK

or AG° = -RTInkK

or AG*° = —2.303 RTlog K (5.23)
We also know that
A,G° = A,H° —TA,S° =-RTInK (5.24)

For strongly endothermic reactions, the
value of A.H° may be large and positive. In
such a case, value of K will be much smaller
than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to
form much product. In case of exothermic
reactions, AH® is large and negative, and A G®°
is likely to be large and negative too. In such
cases, K will be much larger than 1. We may
expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a
large K, and hence can go to near completion.
A G° also depends upon A'S°, if the changes
in the entropy of reaction is also taken into
account, the value of K or extent of chemical
reaction will also be affected, depending upon
whether A_S° is positive or negative.

SUMMARY

Thermodynamics deals with energy changes in chemical or physical processes and enables us to
study these changes quantitatively and to make useful predictions. For these purposes, we divide
the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution
or absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related
through the first law of thermodynamics via AU= q+ w. AU, change in internal energy, depends
on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and
are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of g and w by giving the positive sign to
these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one
system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature
depends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is qg= CAT.
Work can be measured by w = —p, AV, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we
can put p,. = pfor infinitesimal changes in the volume making w,,, = — p dV. In this condition, we
can use gas equation, pV = nRT.

At constant volume, w = 0, then AU = q,, heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of
chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy.
Enthalpy change, AH= AU+ AnRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure,
AH = q,.

There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and
sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes
which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be
calculated using Hess’s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by

A a Ss (2,4 ;Hyroduets ) a »Y (B.A ;Hyeactions)

JS i

and in gaseous state by

A He = 2 bond enthalpies of the reactants — X bond enthalpies of the products

First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical
reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems,
AU = O. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. Entropy is a measure
of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive.
Therefore, for an isolated system, AU = 0, AS > O, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous
change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation

te for a reversible process. -™ is independent of path.

Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function
Gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:

AG= AH-TAS
For a spontaneous change, AG, < 0 and at equilibrium, AG, , = 0.

AS =

Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by

A,G° =—RT In K.

K can be calculated from this equation, if we know A,G° which can be found from
A.G° = A.H° -TA,S°. Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which
are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems
having positive entropy of reaction.
