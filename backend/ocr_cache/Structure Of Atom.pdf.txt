The rich diversity of chemical behaviour of different
elements can be traced to the differences in the internal
structure of atoms of these elements.

The existence of atoms has been proposed since the time
of early Indian and Greek philosophers (400 B.C.) who
were of the view that atoms are the fundamental building
blocks of matter. According to them, the continued
subdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms
which would not be further divisible. The word ‘atom’
has been derived from the Greek word ‘a-tomio’ which
means ‘uncut-able’ or ‘non-divisible’. These earlier ideas
were mere speculations and there was no way to test
them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant for
a very long time and were revived again by scientists in
the nineteenth century.

The atomic theory of matter was first proposed
on a firm scientific basis by John Dalton, a British
school teacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton’s
atomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate
particle of matter (Unit 1). Dalton’s atomic theory was
able to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of
constant composition and law of multiple proportion
very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results
of many experiments, for example, it was known that
substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk
or fur get electrically charged.

In this unit we start with the experimental observations
made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and
beginning of twentieth century. These established that
atoms are made of sub-atomic particles, i.e., electrons,
protons and neutrons — a concept very different from
that of Dalton.

2.1 DISCOVERY OF SUB-ATOMIC
PARTICLES

An insight into the structure of atom was
obtained from the experiments on electrical
discharge through gases. Before we discuss
these results we need to keep in mind a
basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged
particles : “Like charges repel each other and
unlike charges attract each other”.

2.1.1 Discovery of Electron

In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if
electricity is passed through a solution of an
electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the
electrodes, which resulted in the liberation
and deposition of matter at the electrodes.
He formulated certain laws which you will
study in Class XII. These results suggested
the particulate nature of electricity.

In mid 1850s many scientists mainly
Faraday began to study electrical discharge
in partially evacuated tubes, known as
cathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted
in Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of
glass containing two thin pieces of metal,
called electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical
discharge through the gases could be
observed only at very low pressures and at
very high voltages. The pressure of different
gases could be adjusted by evacuation of the
glass tubes. When sufficiently high voltage
is applied across the electrodes, current
starts flowing through a stream of particles
moving in the tube from the negative
electrode (cathode) to the positive electrode
(anode). These were called cathode rays or
cathode ray particles. The flow of current
from cathode to anode was further checked
by making a hole in the anode and coating
the tube behind anode with phosphorescent
material zinc sulphide. When these rays,
after passing through anode, strike the zinc
sulphide coating, a bright spot is developed
on the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)].

The results of these experiments are
summarised below.
(ij) |The cathode rays start from cathode and
move towards the anode.

(ii) These rays themselves are not visible
but their behaviour can be observed
with the help of certain kind of materials
(fluorescent or phosphorescent) which
glow when hit by them. Television
picture tubes are cathode ray tubes
and television pictures result due to
fluorescence on the television screen
coated with certain fluorescent or
phosphorescent materials.

(iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic
field, these rays travel in straight lines
(Fig. 2.2).

(iv) Inthe presence of electrical or magnetic
field, the behaviour of cathode rays are
similar to that expected from negatively
charged particles, suggesting that
the cathode rays consist of negatively
charged particles, called electrons.

(v) The characteristics of cathode rays
(electrons) do not depend upon the

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

material of electrodes and the nature of
the gas present in the cathode ray tube.

Thus, we can conclude that electrons are
basic constituent of all the atoms.

2.1.2 Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron

In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson
measured the ratio of electrical charge (e) to
the mass of electron (m,) by using cathode
ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic
field perpendicular to each other as well as
to the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only
electric field is applied, the electrons deviate
from their path and hit the cathode ray tube
at point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only
magnetic field is applied, electron strikes
the cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully
balancing the electrical and magnetic field
strength, it is possible to bring back the
electron to the path which is followed in the
absence of electric or magnetic field and they
hit the screen at point B. Thomson argued
that the amount of deviation of the particles
from their path in the presence of electrical
or magnetic field depends upon:

(i) the magnitude of the negative charge on
the particle, greater the magnitude of
the charge on the particle, greater is the
interaction with the electric or magnetic
field and thus greater is the deflection.

(ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the
particle, greater the deflection.

Cathode Anode

(iii) the strength of the electrical or magnetic
field — the deflection of electrons from its
original path increases with the increase
in the voltage across the electrodes, or
the strength of the magnetic field.

By carrying out accurate measurements
on the amount of deflections observed by
the electrons on the electric field strength or
magnetic field strength, Thomson was able to
determine the value of e/m, as:

© = 1.758820 x 10" C kg

e

(2.1)

Where m, is the mass of the electron in kg
and e is the magnitude of the charge on the
electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are
negatively charged, the charge on electron
is -e.

2.1.3 Charge on the Electron

R.A. Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method
known as oil drop experiment (1906-14),
to determine the charge on the electrons.
He found the charge on the electron to be
— 1.6 x 107°C. The present accepted value of
electrical charge is — 1.602176 x 107°C. The
mass of the electron (m,) was determined by
combining these results with Thomson’s value
of e/m, ratio.

2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and Neutrons

Electrical discharge carried out in the modified
cathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal
rays carrying positively charged particles. The
characteristics of these positively charged
particles are listed below.

(i) | Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively
charged particles depends upon the
nature of gas present in the cathode
ray tube. These are simply the positively
charged gaseous ions.

(ii) The charge to mass ratio of the particles
depends on the gas from which these
originate.

(iii) Some of the positively charged particles
carry a multiple of the fundamental unit
of electrical charge.

(iv) The behaviour of these particles in the
magnetic or electrical field is opposite
to that observed for electron or cathode
rays.

The smallest and lightest positive ion
was obtained from hydrogen and was called
proton. This positively charged particle was
characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt
for the presence of electrically neutral particle
as one of the constituent of atom. These
particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932)
by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium
by a-particles. When electrically neutral
particles having a mass slightly greater than
that of protons were emitted. He named
these particles as neutrons. The important
properties of all these fundamental particles
are given in Table 2.1.

2.2 ATOMIC MODELS

Observations obtained from the experiments
mentioned in the previous sections have
suggested that Dalton’s indivisible atom is
composed of sub-atomic particles carrying
positive and negative charges. The major
problems before the scientists after the
discovery of sub-atomic particles were:

e to account for the stability of atom,

e to compare the behaviour of elements
in terms of both physical and chemical
properties,

CHEMISTRY

Millikan’s Oil Drop Method

In this method, oil droplets in the form of
mist, produced by the atomiser, were allowed
to enter through a tiny hole in the upper
plate of electrical condenser. The downward
motion of these droplets was viewed through
the telescope, equipped with a micrometer
eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of
these droplets, Millikan was able to measure
the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the
chamber was ionized by passing a beam of
X-rays through it. The electrical charge on
these oil droplets was acquired by collisions
with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged
oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or
made stationary depending upon the charge
on the droplets and the polarity and strength
of the voltage applied to the plate. By
carefully measuring the effects of electrical
field strength on the motion of oil droplets,
Millikan concluded that the magnitude of
electrical charge, q, on the droplets is always
an integral multiple of the electrical charge,
e, that is, q=ne, where n = 1, 2,3....

Different atomic models were proposed
to explain the distributions of these charged
particles in an atom. Although some of these
models were not able to explain the stability
of atoms, two of these models, one proposed
by J.J. Thomson and the other proposed by
Ernest Rutherford are discussed below.

2.2.1 Thomson Model of Atom

J. J. Thomson, in 1898, proposed that an
atom possesses a spherical shape (radius
approximately 10°!° m) in which the positive
charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons
are embedded into it in such a manner as to
give the most stable electrostatic arrangement
(Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given
to this model, for example, plum pudding,
raisin pudding or watermelon. This model

Positive sphere

Electron

Fig.2.4 Thomson model of atom

can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon
of positive charge with plums or seeds
(electrons) embedded into it. An important
feature of this model is that the mass of the
atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed
over the atom. Although this model was able
to explain the overall neutrality of the atom,
but was not consistent with the results of later
experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel
Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical
and experimental investigations on the
conduction of electricity by gases.

In the later half of the nineteenth century
different kinds of rays were discovered,

besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm
Roentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed
that when electrons strike a material in
the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which
can cause fluorescence in the fluorescent
materials placed outside the cathode ray
tubes. Since R6éentgen did not know the
nature of the radiation, he named them
X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was
noticed that X-rays are produced effectively
when electrons strike the dense metal anode,
called targets. These are not deflected by the
electric and magnetic fields and have a very
high penetrating power through the matter
and that is the reason that these rays are
used to study the interior of the objects.
These rays are of very short wavelengths
(~O.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic
character (Section 2.3.1).

Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed
that there are certain elements which emit
radiation on their own and named this
phenomenon as radioactivity and the
elements known as radioactive elements.
This field was developed by Marie Curie,
Piere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy.
It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e.,
a, B- and y-rays are emitted. Rutherford
found that a-rays consists of high energy
particles carrying two units of positive charge
and four unit of atomic mass. He concluded
that a- particles are helium nuclei as when a-
particles combined with two electrons yielded
helium gas. B-rays are negatively charged

34

particles similar to electrons. The y-rays
are high energy radiations like X-rays, are
neutral in nature and do not consist of
particles. As regards penetrating power,
a-particles are the least, followed by B-rays
(100 times that of a-particles) and y-rays
(1000 times of that o-particles).

2.2.2 Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of Atom

Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger
and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin
gold foil with a—particles. Rutherford’s famous

CHEMISTRY

represented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high
energy a-particles from a radioactive source
was directed at a thin foil (thickness ~ 100 nm)
of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular
fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it.
Whenever o-particles struck the screen, a
tiny flash of light was produced at that point.

The results of scattering experiment were
quite unexpected. According to Thomson
model of atom, the mass of each gold atom
in the foil should have been spread evenly
over the entire atom, and a-particles had
enough energy to pass directly through sucha
uniform distribution of mass. It was expected
that the particles would slow down and
change directions only by a small angles as
they passed through the foil. It was observed
that:

(i) most of the a-particles passed through
the gold foil undeflected.

(ii) asmall fraction of the a-particles was
deflected by small angles.

(iii) a very few o-particles (~1 in 20,000)
bounced back, that is, were deflected by
nearly 180’.

On the basis of the observations,
Rutherford drew the following conclusions
regarding the structure of atom:

(ij) | Mostofthe space in the atom is empty as
most of the o—particles passed through
the foil undeflected.

(ii) Afew positively charged a—particles were
deflected. The deflection must be due
to enormous repulsive force showing
that the positive charge of the atom
is not spread throughout the atom as
Thomson had presumed. The positive
charge has to be concentrated in a very
small volume that repelled and deflected
the positively charged a-—particles.

(iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that
the volume occupied by the nucleus
is negligibly small as compared to the
total volume of the atom. The radius of
the atom is about 10°-!°m, while that of
nucleus is 10°'Sm. One can appreciate
this difference in size by realising that if

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then
the radius of atom would be about 5 km.

On the basis of above observations and
conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear
model of atom. According to this model:

(i) |The positive charge and most of the mass
of the atom was densely concentrated in
extremely small region. This very small
portion of the atom was called nucleus
by Rutherford.

(ii) The nucleus is surrounded by electrons
that move around the nucleus with a
very high speed in circular paths called
orbits. Thus, Rutherford’s model of atom
resembles the solar system in which the
nucleus plays the role of sun and the
electrons that of revolving planets.

(iii) Electrons and the nucleus are held
together by electrostatic forces of
attraction.

2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass Number

The presence of positive charge on the nucleus
is due to the protons in the nucleus. As
established earlier, the charge on the proton
is equal but opposite to that of electron. The
number of protons present in the nucleus is
equal to atomic number (Z). For example, the
number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus
is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their
atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively.
In order to keep the electrical neutrality,
the number of electrons in an atom is equal
to the number of protons (atomic number,
Z). For example, number of electrons in
hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and
11 respectively.

Atomic number (Z) = number of protons in
the nucleus of an atom

= number of electrons

in anuetral atom (2.3)

While the positive charge of the nucleus
is due to protons, the mass of the nucleus,
due to protons and neutrons. As discussed
earlier protons and neutrons present in the
nucleus are collectively known as nucleons.

35

The total number of nucleons is termed as
mass number (A) of the atom.

mass number (A) = number of protons (Z)

+ number of

neutrons (n) (2.4)

2.2.4 Isobars and Isotopes

The composition of any atom can be
represented by using the normal element
symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand
side as the atomic mass number (A) and
subscript (Z) on the left hand side as the
atomic number (i.e., } X).

Isobars are the atoms with same mass
number but different atomic number for
example, {'C and *N. On the other hand,
atoms with identical atomic number but
different atomic mass number are known
as Isotopes. In other words (according to
equation 2.4), it is evident that difference
between the isotopes is due to the presence
of different number of neutrons present in
the nucleus. For example, considering of
hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen
atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is
called protium (/H). Rest of the percentage of
hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes,
the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron
is called deuterium (?D, 0.015%) and the
other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons
is called tritium (?T ). The latter isotope is
found in trace amounts on the earth. Other
examples of commonly occuring isotopes are:
carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons
besides 6 protons (PC, eC, C); chlorine
atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides
17 protons (°°Cl, Cl).

Lastly an important point to mention
regarding isotopes is that chemical properties
of atoms are controlled by the number of
electrons, which are determined by the number
of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons
present in the nucleus have very little effect
on the chemical properties of an element.
Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element
show same chemical behaviour.

Problem 2.1

Calculate the number of protons,
neutrons and electrons in §?Br.

Solution

In this case, 8° Br, Z = 35, A= 80, species

is neutral _*

Number of protons = number of electrons
=Z=35

Number of neutrons = 80 —- 35 = 45,
(equation 2.4)

Problem 2.2

The number of electrons, protons and
neutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16
and 16 respectively. Assign the proper
symbol to the species.

Solution

The atomic number is equal to
number of protons = 16. The element is
sulphur (S).

Atomic mass number = number of
protons + number of neutrons

= 16+ 16=32

Species is not neutral as the number of
protons is not equal to electrons. It is
anion (negatively charged) with charge
equal to excess electrons = 18 —- 16 = 2.
Symbol is %S*.

Note : Before using the notation 7 X,
find out whether the species is a neutral
atom, a cation or an anion. If it is a
neutral atom, equation (2.3) is valid, i.e.,
number of protons = number of electrons
= atomic number. If the species is an
ion, determine whether the number of
protons are larger (cation, positive ion)
or smaller (anion, negative ion) than the
number of electrons. Number of neutrons
is always given by A-Z, whether the
species is neutral or ion.

2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford Model

As you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear
model of an atom is like a small scale solar
system with the nucleus playing the role

CHEMISTRY

of the massive sun and the electrons being
similar to the lighter planets. When classical
mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it
shows that the planets describe well-defined
orbits around the sun. The gravitational force
between the planets is given by the expression

mm
[c. mur where m, and m, are the masses,
r

ris the distance of separation of the masses
and G is the gravitational constant. The theory
can also calculate precisely the planetary
orbits and these are in agreement with the
experimental measurements.

The similarity between the solar system
and nuclear model suggests that electrons
should move around the nucleus in well
defined orbits. Further, the coulomb force
(kq,q,/7° where q, and q, are the charges, r
is the distance of separation of the charges
and kis the proportionality constant) between
electron and the nucleus is mathematically
similar to the gravitational force. However,
when a body is moving in an orbit, it
undergoes acceleration even if it is moving
with a constant speed in an orbit because
of changing direction. So an electron in the
nuclear model describing planet like orbits
is under acceleration. According to the
electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged
particles when accelerated should emit
electromagnetic radiation (This feature does
not exist for planets since they are uncharged).
Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit
radiation, the energy carried by radiation
comes from electronic motion. The orbit will
thus continue to shrink. Calculations show
that it should take an electron only 10° s
to spiral into the nucleus. But this does
not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model
cannot explain the stability of an atom.
If the motion of an electron is described on
the basis of the classical mechanics and
electromagnetic theory, you may ask that
since the motion of electrons in orbits is
leading to the instability of the atom, then
why not consider electrons as stationary

* Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic

objects.

around the nucleus. If the electrons were
stationary, electrostatic attraction between
the dense nucleus and the electrons would
pull the electrons toward the nucleus to
form a miniature version of Thomson’s model
of atom.

Another serious drawback of the
Rutherford model is that it says nothing
about distribution of the electrons around the
nucleus and the energies of these electrons.

2.3. DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO THE
BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOM

Historically, results observed from the studies
of interactions of radiations with matter have
provided immense information regarding
the structure of atoms and molecules. Neils
Bohr utilised these results to improve upon
the model proposed by Rutherford. Two
developments played a major role in the
formulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These
were:

(i) Dual character of the electromagnetic
radiation which means that radiations
possess both wave like and particle like
properties, and

(ii) Experimental results regarding atomic
spectra.

First, we will discuss about the duel nature
of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental
results regarding atomic spectra will be
discussed in Section 2.4.

2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic
Radiation

In the mid-nineteenth century, physicists
actively studied absorption and emission of
radiation by heated objects. These are called
thermal radiations. They tried to find out of
what the thermal radiation is made. It is now
a well-known fact that thermal radiations
consist of electromagnetic waves of various
frequencies or wavelengths. It is based on
a number of modern concepts, which were
unknown in the mid-nineteenth century.
First active study of thermal radiation laws
occured in the 1850’s and the theory of
electromagnetic waves and the emission of
such waves by accelerating charged particles

37

was developed in the early 1870’s by James
Clerk Maxwell, which was experimentally
confirmed later by Heinrich Hertz. Here, we
will learn some facts about electromagnetic
radiations.

James Maxwell (1870) was the first to
give a comprehensive explanation about the
interaction between the charged bodies and
the behaviour of electrical and magnetic
fields on macroscopic level. He suggested
that when electrically charged particle moves
under accelaration, alternating electrical and
magnetic fields are produced and transmitted.
These fields are transmitted in the forms
of waves called electromagnetic waves or
electromagnetic radiation.

Light is the form of radiation known from
early days and speculation about its nature
dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier
days (Newton) light was supposed to be made
of particles (corpuscules). It was only in the
19th century when wave nature of light was
established.

Maxwell was again the first to reveal that
light waves are associated with oscillating
electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6).

Although electromagnetic wave motion is

complex in nature, we will consider here only

a few simple properties.

fields produced by oscillating charged

particles are perpendicular to each
other and both are perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the wave.
Simplified picture of electromagnetic
wave is shown in Fig. 2.6.

(ii) Unlike sound waves or waves produced
in water, electromagnetic waves do
not require medium and can move in
vacuum.

(iii) It is now well established that there

are many types of electromagnetic

radiations, which differ from one
another in wavelength (or frequency).

These constitute what is called

electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7).

Different regions of the spectrum are

identified by different names. Some

examples are: radio frequency region
around 10° Hz, used for broadcasting;
microwave region around 10!°Hz used

for radar; infrared region around 10!%

Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region

around 10!°Hz a component of sun’s

radiation. The small portion around 101°

Hz, is what is ordinarily called visible

light. It is only this part which our eyes

can see (or detect). Special instruments
are required to detect non-visible

CHEMISTRY

Different kinds of units are used to
represent electromagnetic radiation.

(iv)

These radiations are characterised by
the properties, namely, frequency (v) and
wavelength (A).

The SI unit for frequency (v) is hertz
(Hz, s’), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as
the number of waves that pass a given point
in one second.

Wavelength should have the units of
length and as you know that the SI units of
length is meter (m). Since electromagnetic
radiation consists of different kinds of waves
of much smaller wavelengths, smaller units
are used. Fig. 2.7 shows various types of
electro-magnetic radiations which differ from

The other commonly used quantity

per unit length. Its units are reciprocal of
wavelength unit, i.e., m-'. However commonly
used unit is cm™ (not SI unit).

2.3.2 Particle Nature of Electromagnetic
Radiation: Planck’s Quantum
Theory

Some of the experimental phenomenon
such as diffraction* and interference** can
be explained by the wave nature of the
electromagnetic radiation. However, following
are some of the observations which could
not be explained with the help of even the
electromagentic theory of 19th century
physics (known as classical physics):

(ij) the nature of emission of radiation from
hot bodies (black-body radiation)

(ii) | ejection of electrons from metal surface
when radiation strikes it (photoelectric
effect)

(iii) variation of heat capacity of solids as a
function of temperature

** Interference is the combination of two waves of the same or different frequencies to give a wave whose distribution at each
point in space is the algebraic or vector sum of disturbances at that point resulting from each interfering wave.

(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special
reference to hydrogen.

These phenomena indicate that the system
can take energy only in discrete amounts.
All possible energies cannot be taken up or
radiated.

It is noteworthy that the first concrete
explanation for the phenomenon of the black
body radiation mentioned above was given
by Max Planck in 1900. Let us first try to
understand this phenomenon, whichis given
below:

Hot objects emit electromagnetic
radiations over a wide range of wavelengths.
At high temperatures, an appreciable
proportion of radiation is in the visible
region of the spectrum. As the temperature
is raised, a higher proportion of short
wavelength (blue light) is generated. For
example, when an iron rod is heated in a
furnace, it first turns to dull red and then
progressively becomes more and more red
as the temperature increases. As this is
heated further, the radiation emitted becomes
white and then becomes blue as the
temperature becomes very high. This means
that red radiation is most intense ata
particular temperature and the blue radiation
is more intense at another temperature. This
means intensities of radiations of different
wavelengths emitted by hot body depend
upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was
known that objects made of different material
and kept at different temperatures emit
different amount of radiation. Also, when the
surface of an object is irradiated with light
(electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant
energy is generally reflected as such, a part
is absorbed and a part of it is transmitted.
The reason for incomplete absorption is
that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect
absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which
emits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies
uniformly, is called a black body and the
radiation emitted by such a body is called
black body radiation. In practice, no such
body exists. Carbon black approximates
fairly closely to black body. A good physical
approximation to a black body is a cavity with a
tiny hole, which has no other opening. Any ray

CHEMISTRY

entering the hole will be reflected by the cavity
walls and will be eventually absorbed by the
walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator of
radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is
in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.
It radiates same amount of energy per unit
area as it absorbs from its surrounding in
any given time. The amount of light emitted
(intensity of radiation) from a black body
and its spectral distribution depends only
on its temperature. At a given temperature,
intensity of radiation emitted increases
with the increase of wavelength, reaches a
maximum value at a given wavelength and
then starts decreasing with further increase of
wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the
temperature increases, maxima of the curve
shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts
were made to predict the intensity of radiation
as a function of wavelength.

But the results of the above experiment
could not be explained satisfactorily on
the basis of the wave theory of light. Max
Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship

by making an assumption that absorption
and emmission of radiation arises from
oscillator i.e., atoms in the wall of black
body. Their frequency of oscillation is
changed by interaction with oscilators of
electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed
that radiation could be sub-divided into
discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that
atoms and molecules could emit or absorb
energy only in discrete quantities and not
in a continuous manner. He gave the name
quantum to the smallest quantity of energy
that can be emitted or absorbed in the form
of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (£)
of a quantum of radiation is proportional
to its frequency (v) and is expressed by
equation (2.6).
E=ho (2.6)
The proportionality constant, ‘h’ is known
as Planck’s constant and has the value
6.626x104J s.

With this theory, Planck was able to explain
the distribution of intensity in the radiation
from black body as a function of frequency or
wavelength at different temperatures.

Quantisation has been compared to
standing on a staircase. A person can stand
on any step ofa staircase, but it is not possible
for him/her to stand in between the two steps.
The energy can take any one of the values
from the following set, but cannot take on any
values between them.

Max Planck
(1858-1947)
Max Planck, a German physicist,
received his Ph.D in theoretical
physics from the University of
Munich in 1879. In 1888, he

was appointed Director of the

Institute of Theoretical Physics

at the University of Berlin.
Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made
significant contributions in thermodynamics and
other areas of physics.

Photoelectric Effect

In 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting
experiment in which electrons (or electric
current) were ejected when certain metals
(for example potassium, rubidium, caesium
etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown
in Fig.2.9. The phenomenon is called
Photoelectric effect. The results observed
in this experiment were:

(i) |The electrons are ejected from the metal
surface as soon as the beam of light
strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time
lag between the striking of light beam and
the ejection of electrons from the metal
surface.

(ii) The number of electrons ejected is
proportional to the intensity or brightness
of light.

(iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic
minimum frequency,v, (also known
as threshold frequency) below which
photoelectric effect is not observed. At
a frequency v >v,, the ejected electrons
come out with certain kinetic energy.
The kinetic energies of these electrons
increase with the increase of frequency
of the light used.

All the above results could not be explained
on the basis of laws of classical physics.
According to latter, the energy content of the
beam of light depends upon the brightness of
the light. In other words, number of electrons
ejected and kinetic energy associated with
them should depend on the brightness of light.
It has been observed that though the number

CHEMISTRY

Table 2.2 Values of Work Function (W,) for a Few Metals

of electrons ejected does depend upon the
brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the
ejected electrons does not. For example, red
light [v = (4.3 to 4.6) x 10'* Hz] of any brightness
(intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium
metal for hours but no photoelectrons are
ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak
yellow light (v = 5.1-5.2 x 10'* Hz) shines on
the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect
is observed. The threshold frequency (v,) for
potassium metal is 5.0x10'* Hz.

Einstein (1905) was able to explain the
photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum
theory of electromagnetic radiation as a
starting point.

Albert Einstein, a German born
American physicist, is regarded
by many as one of the two great
physicists the world has known
(the other is Isaac Newton). His
three research papers (on special
relativity, Brownian motion and

the photoelectric effect) which Albert Einstein

he published in 1905, while he
was employed as a technical
assistant in a Swiss patent office in Berne have
profoundly influenced the development of physics.
He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for
his explanation of the photoelectric effect.

(1879-1955)

Shining a beam of light on to a metal
surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting
a beam of particles, the photons. When a
photon of sufficient energy strikes an electron
in the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy
instantaneously to the electron during the
collision and the electron is ejected without
any time lag or delay. Greater the energy
possessed by the photon, greater will be
transfer of energy to the electron and greater
the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In
other words, kinetic energy of the ejected
electron is proportional to the frequency
of the electromagnetic radiation. Since the
striking photon has energy equal to hv and

the minimum energy required to eject the
electron is hv, (also called work function,
Wo; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy
(hv — hv,) is transferred as the kinetic energy of
the photoelectron. Following the conservation
of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the
ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.

hv = hv, + din? (2.7)
where m, is the mass of the electron and vis the
velocity associated with the ejected electron.
Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists
of larger number of photons, consequently the
number of electrons ejected is also larger as
compared to that in an experiment in which a
beam of weaker intensity of light is employed.

Dual Behaviour
Radiation

of Electromagnetic

The particle nature of light posed a dilemma for
scientists. On the one hand, it could explain
the black body radiation and photoelectric
effect satisfactorily but on the other hand,
it was not consistent with the known wave
behaviour of light which could account for the
phenomena of interference and diffraction.
The only way to resolve the dilemma was
to accept the idea that light possesses
both particle and wave-like properties, i.e.,
light has dual behaviour. Depending on
the experiment, we find that light behaves
either as a wave or as a stream of particles.
Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it
displays particle like properties in contrast
to the wavelike properties (interference
and diffraction), which it exhibits when it
propagates. This concept was totally alien to
the way the scientists thought about matter
and radiation and it took them a long time to
become convinced of its validity. It turns out,
as you shall see later, that some microscopic
particles like electrons also exhibit this wave-
particle duality.

2.3.3 Evidence for the quantized*
Electronic Energy Levels: Atomic
spectra

The speed of light depends upon the nature
of the medium through which it passes. As a
result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted
from its original path as it passes from one
medium to another. It is observed that when
aray of white light is passed through a prism,
the wave with shorter wavelength bends more
than the one with a longer wavelength. Since
ordinary white light consists of waves with
all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray
of white light is spread out into a series of
coloured bands called spectrum. The light of
red colour which has longest wavelength is
deviated the least while the violet light, which
has shortest wavelength is deviated the most.
The spectrum of white light, that we can
see, ranges from violet at 7.50 x 10'* Hz to
red at 4x10'* Hz. Such a spectrum is called
continuous spectrum. Continuous because
violet merges into blue, blue into green and
so on. A similar spectrum is produced when
a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that
visible light is just a small portion of the
electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When
electromagnetic radiation interacts with
matter, atoms and molecules may absorb
energy and reach to a higher energy state. With
higher energy, these are in an unstable state.
For returning to their normal (more stable,
lower energy states) energy state, the atoms
and molecules emit radiations in various
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Emission and Absorption Spectra
The spectrum of radiation emitted by a
substance that has absorbed energy is called
an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or
ions that have absorbed radiation are said
to be “excited”. To produce an emission
spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by
heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength
(or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as
the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is
recorded.

An absorption spectrum is like the
photographic negative of an emission

CHEMISTRY

spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed
through a sample which absorbs radiation of
certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength
which corresponds to the radiation absorbed
by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright
continuous spectrum.

The study of emission or absorption
spectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The
spectrum of the visible light, as discussed
above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red
to violet) of the visible light are represented in
the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in
the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show
a continuous spread of wavelength from red
to violet, rather they emit light only at specific
wavelengths with dark spaces between them.
Such spectra are called line spectra or
atomic spectra because the emitted radiation
is identified by the appearance of bright lines
in the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).

Line emission spectra are of great
interest in the study of electronic structure.
Each element has a unique line emission
spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic
spectra can be used in chemical analysis to
identify unknown atoms in the same way
as fingerprints are used to identify people.
The exact matching of lines of the emission
spectrum of the atoms of a known element
with the lines from an unknown sample
quickly establishes the identity of the latter,
German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899)
was one of the first investigators to use line
spectra to identify elements.

Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs)
thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and
scandium (Sc) were discovered when their
minerals were analysed by spectroscopic
methods. The element helium (He) was
discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.

Line Spectrum of Hydrogen

When an electric discharge is passed through
gaseous hydrogen, the H, molecules dissociate
and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms
produced emit electromagnetic radiation of
discrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum
consists of several series of lines named after
their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885
on the basis of experimental observations

* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.

Fig. 2.10 (a) Atomic emission. The light emitted by a sample of excited hydrogen atoms (or any other
element) can be passed through a prism and separated into certain discrete wavelengths. Thus an emission
spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any
sample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only
one excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as
these atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. (b) Atomic absorption. When white

atom. There are, however, certain features
which are common to all line spectra, i.e.,
(i) line spectrum of element is unique and
(ii) there is regularity in the line spectrum of
each element. The questions which arise are:
What are the reasons for these similarities?
Is it something to do with the electronic
structure of atoms? These are the questions
need to be answered. We shall find later that
the answers to these questions provide the
key in understanding electronic structure of
these elements.

2.4 BOHR’S MODEL FOR HYDROGEN
ATOM

Neils Bohr (1913) was the first to explain
quantitatively the general features of the
structure of hydrogen atom and its spectrum.
He used Planck’s concept of quantisation
of energy. Though the theory is not the
modern quantum mechanics, it can still
be used to rationalize many points in the

CHEMISTRY

atomic structure and spectra. Bohr’s model
for hydrogen atom is based on the following
postulates:

i) The electron in the hydrogen atom can
move around the nucleus in a circular
path of fixed radius and energy. These
paths are called orbits, stationary states
or allowed energy states. These orbits
are arranged concentrically around the
nucleus.

ii) The energy of an electron in the orbit
does not change with time. However,
the electron will move from a lower
stationary state to a higher stationary
state when required amount of energy
is absorbed by the electron or energy is
emitted when electron moves from higher
stationary state to lower stationary state
(equation 2.16). The energy change does
not take place in a continuous manner.

Angular Momentum

Just as linear momentum is the product
of mass (m) and linear velocity (v), angular
momentum is the product of moment of
inertia (J) and angular velocity (). For an
electron of mass m,, moving in a circular
path of radius r around the nucleus,

angular momentum = Ix @

Since I= mx’, and o = v/rwhere v is the
linear velocity,

“angular momentum = m,P x v/r= myvr

iii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or
emitted when transition occurs between
two stationary states that differ in
energy by AE, is given by:

_AE _E,~-E,
h h
Where E, and E, are the energies of the
lower and higher allowed energy states
respectively. This expression is commonly
known as Bohr’s frequency rule.

(2.10)

iv) The angular momentum of an electron
is quantised. In a given stationary state
it can be expressed as in equation (2.11)
(2.11)

e

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

Where m,is the mass of electron, v is the
velocity and ris the radius of the orbit in
which electron is moving.

Thus an electron can move only in those
orbits for which its angular momentum is
integral multiple of h/2x. That means angular
momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted
or obsorbed only when transition of electron
takes place from one quantised value of
angular momentum to another. Therefore,
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory does not
apply here that is why only certain fixed orbits
are allowed.

The details regarding the derivation of
energies of the stationary states used by Bohr,
are quite complicated and will be discussed in
higher classes. However, according to Bohr’s
theory for hydrogen atom:

a) The stationary states for electron are
numbered n= 1,2,3.......... These integral
numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as
Principal quantum numbers.

b) The radii of the stationary states are
expressed as:
r=Wwa, (2.12)

where a, = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of
the first stationary state, called the Bohr
orbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron
in the hydrogen atom is found in this
orbit (that is n=1). As n increases the
value of r will increase. In other words
the electron will be present away from
the nucleus.

c) The mostimportant property associated
with the electron, is the energy of its
stationary state. It is given by the
expression.

where R,, is called Rydberg constant and

Niels Bohr

(1885-1962)

Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist

received his Ph.D. from the

University of Copenhagen in
= 1911. He then spent a year

with J.J. Thomson and Ernest

Rutherford in England. In 1913,

he returned to Copenhagen where he remained for
the rest of his life. In 1920 he was named Director
of the Institute of theoretical Physics. After first
World War, Bohr worked energetically for peaceful
uses of atomic energy. He received the first Atoms
for Peace award in 1957. Bohr was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.

Fig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different
stationary states or energy levels of hydrogen
atom. This representation is called an energy
level diagram.

When the electron is free from the influence
of nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The
electron in this situation is associated with the
stationary state of Principal Quantum number
= n=oandis called as ionized hydrogen atom.
When the electron is attracted by the nucleus
and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted
and its energy is lowered. That is the reason

What does the negative electronic
energy (E.) for hydrogen atom mean?

The energy of the electron in a hydrogen
atom has a negative sign for all possible
orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative
sign convey? This negative sign means
that the energy of the electron in the
atom is lower than the energy of a free
electron at rest. A free electron at rest
is an electron that is infinitely far away
from the nucleus and is assigned the
energy value of zero. Mathematically, this
corresponds to setting n equal to infinity
in the equation (2.13) so that E =O. As the
electron gets closer to the nucleus (as n
decreases), E, becomes larger in absolute
value and more and more negative. The
most negative energy value is given by
n=1 which corresponds to the most stable
orbit. We call this the ground state.

for the presence of negative sign in equation

(2.13) and depicts its stability relative to the

reference state of zero energy and n= o.

d)  Bohr’s theory can also be applied to
the ions containing only one electron,
similar to that present in hydrogen
atom. For example, He’* Li**, Be** and so
on. The energies of the stationary states
associated with these kinds of ions (also
known as hydrogen like species) are
given by the expression.

where Z is the atomic number and has
values 2,3 for the helium and lithium atoms
respectively. From the above equations, it is
evident that the value of energy becomes more
negative and that of radius becomes smaller
with increase of Z. This means that electron
will be tightly bound to the nucleus.

e) It is also possible to calculate the
velocities of electrons moving in these
orbits. Although the precise equation
is not given here, qualitatively the
magnitude of velocity of electron
increases with increase of positive
charge on the nucleus and decreases
with increase of principal quantum
number.

2.4.1 Explanation of Line Spectrum of
Hydrogen

Line spectrum observed in case of hydrogen
atom, as mentioned in section 2.3.3, can be
explained quantitatively using Bohr’s model.
According to assumption 2, radiation (energy)
is absorbed if the electron moves from the
orbit of smaller Principal quantum number to
the orbit of higher Principal quantum number,
whereas the radiation (energy) is emitted if
the electron moves from higher orbit to lower
orbit. The energy gap between the two orbits
is given by equation (2.16)

AE = E,- E, (2.16)

In case of absorption spectrum, n,> n, and

The expression (2.17) is similar to that
used by Rydberg (2.9) derived empirically
using the experimental data available at that
time. Further, each spectral line, whether
in absorption or emission spectrum, can
be associated to the particular transition in
hydrogen atom. In case of large number of
hydrogen atoms, different possible transitions
can be observed and thus leading to large
number of spectral lines. The brightness or
intensity of spectral lines depends upon the
number of photons of same wavelength or
frequency absorbed or emitted.

2.4.2 Limitations of Bohr’s Model

Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was no
doubt an improvement over Rutherford’s
nuclear model, as it could account for the
stability and line spectra of hydrogen atom
and hydrogen like ions (for example, He’, Li**,
Be**, and so on). However, Bohr’s model was
too simple to account for the following points.

i) It fails to account for the finer details
(doublet, that is two closely spaced lines)
of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed
by using sophisticated spectroscopic
techniques. This model is also unable
to explain the spectrum of atoms
other than hydrogen, for example,
helium atom which possesses only two
electrons. Further, Bohr’s theory was
also unable to explain the splitting
of spectral lines in the presence of
magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an
electric field (Stark effect).

ii) | It could not explain the ability of atoms
to form molecules by chemical bonds.

In other words, taking into account the
points mentioned above, one needs a better
theory which can explain the salient features
of the structure of complex atoms.

2.55 TOWARDS QUANTUM MECHANICAL
MODEL OF THE ATOM

In view of the shortcoming of the Bohr’s
model, attempts were made to develop a more
suitable and general model for atoms. Two
important developments which contributed
significantly in the formulation of such a
model were:

1. Dual behaviour of matter,

2. Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

2.5.1 Dual Behaviour of Matter

The French physicist, de Broglie, in 1924
proposed that matter, like radiation, should
also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle
and wavelike properties. This means that
just as the photon has momentum as well
as wavelength, electrons should also have
momentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie,
from this analogy, gave the following relation
between wavelength (A) and momentum (p) of
a material particle.

Louis de Broglie

(1892-1987)

Louis de Broglie, a French

physicist, studied history

as an undergraduate in the

early 1910’s. His interest

turned to science as a result

of his assignment to radio

communications in World

Warl. He received his

Dr. Sc. from the University of Paris in 1924.
He was professor of theoretical physics at
the University of Paris from 1932 untill his
retirement in 1962. He was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.

yeh
mv p
where m is the mass of the particle, v its
velocity and p its momentum. de Broglie’s
prediction was confirmed experimentally when
it was found that an electron beam undergoes
diffraction, a phenomenon characteristic of
waves. This fact has been put to use in making
an electron microscope, which is based on
the wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an
ordinary microscope utilises the wave nature
of light. An electron microscope is a powerful
tool in modern scientific research because it
achieves a magnification of about 15 million
times.

(2.22)

It needs to be noted that according to de
Broglie, every object in motion has a wave
character. The wavelengths associated with
ordinary objects are so short (because of their
large masses) that their wave properties cannot
be detected. The wavelengths associated with
electrons and other subatomic particles (with
very small mass) can however be detected
experimentally. Results obtained from
the following problems prove these points
qualitatively.

2.5.2 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle

Werner Heisenberg a German physicist in
1927, stated uncertainty principle which is
the consequence of dual behaviour of matter
and radiation. It states that it is impossible
to determine simultaneously, the exact
position and exact momentum (or velocity)
of an electron.

Mathematically, it can be given as in
equation (2.23).

where Ax is the uncertainty in position and
Ap, (or Av,) is the uncertainty in momentum
(or velocity) of the particle. If the position of
the electron is known with high degree of
accuracy (Ax is small), then the velocity of the
electron will be uncertain [A(v,) is large]. On
the other hand, if the velocity of the electron
is known precisely (A(v,) is small), then the
position of the electron will be uncertain
(Ax will be large). Thus, if we carry out some
physical measurements on the electron’s
position or velocity, the outcome will always
depict a fuzzy or blur picture.

The uncertainty principle can be best
understood with the help of an example.
Suppose you are asked to measure the
thickness of a sheet of paper with an
unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results
obtained would be extremely inaccurate
and meaningless. In order to obtain any
accuracy, you should use an instrument
graduated in units smaller than the thickness
of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order
to determine the position of an electron, we
must use a meterstick calibrated in units of
smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep
in mind that an electron is considered as a
point charge and is therefore, dimensionless).
To observe an electron, we can illuminate it
with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The
“light” used must have a wavelength smaller
than the dimensions of an electron. The high

51

h
momentum photons of such light [p= *)

would change the energy of electrons by
collisions. In this process we, no doubt,
would be able to calculate the position of the
electron, but we would know very little about
the velocity of the electron after the collision.

Significance of Uncertainty Principle

One of the important implications of the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it
rules out existence of definite paths or
trajectories of electrons and other similar
particles. The trajectory of an object is
determined by its location and velocity at
various moments. If we know where a body
is at a particular instant and if we also know
its velocity and the forces acting on it at that
instant, we can tell where the body would
be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude
that the position of an object and its velocity
fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic
object such as an electron, it is not possible
simultaneously to determine the position and
velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary
degree of precision, it is not possible to talk
of the trajectory of an electron.

The effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle is significant only for motion of
microscopic objects and is negligible for
that of macroscopic objects. This can be
seen from the following examples.

If uncertainty principle is applied to an
object of mass, say about a milligram (10°kg),
then

physics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max
Born at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of

physics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg
was in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named
director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished

The value of AvAx obtained is extremely
small and is insignificant. Therefore, one
may say that in dealing with milligram-
sized or heavier objects, the associated
uncertainties are hardly of any real
consequence.

In the case of a microscopic object like an
electron on the other hand. Av.Ax obtained is
much larger and such uncertainties are of real
consequence. For example, for an electron

that the electron has at a given position

This is nearly ~ 10'* times smaller
than the diameter of a typical atomic
nucleus. As mentioned earlier for large
particles, the uncertainty principle sets
no meaningful limit to the precision of
measurements.

Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model

One can now understand the reasons for the
failure of the Bohr model. In Bohr model,
an electron is regarded as a charged particle
moving in well defined circular orbits about
the nucleus. The wave character of the
electron is not considered in Bohr model.
Further, an orbit is a clearly defined path
and this path can completely be defined
only if both the position and the velocity of
the electron are known exactly at the same
time. This is not possible according to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model
of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only
ignores dual behaviour of matter but also
contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Erwin Schrédinger, an
Austrian physicist received
his Ph.D. in theoretical
physics from the University
of Vienna in 1910. In 1927
Schrédinger succeeded Max
Planck at the University of
Berlin at Planck’s request.
In 1933, Schrédinger left

Berlin because of his payin Schrédinger

opposition to Hitler and
Nazi policies and returned
to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria
by Germany, Schrédinger was forcibly removed
from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin,
Ireland where he remained for seventeen years.
Schrédinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics
with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.

(1887-1961)

In view of these inherent weaknesses in the
Bohr model, there was no point in extending
Bohr model to other atoms. In fact an insight
into the structure of the atom was needed
which could account for wave-particle duality
of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg
uncertainty principle. This came with the
advent of quantum mechanics.

2.6 QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF
ATOM

Classical mechanics, based on Newton’s
laws of motion, successfully describes the
motion of all macroscopic objects such as a
falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have
essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown
in the previous section. However it fails when
applied to microscopic objects like electrons,
atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because
of the fact that classical mechanics ignores
the concept of dual behaviour of matter
especially for sub-atomic particles and the
uncertainty principle. The branch of science
that takes into account this dual behaviour
of matter is called quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics is a theoretical
science that deals with the study of the
motions of the microscopic objects that have
both observable wave like and particle like
properties. It specifies the laws of motion that

53

these objects obey. When quantum mechanics
is applied to macroscopic objects (for which
wave like properties are insignificant) the
results are the same as those from the
classical mechanics.

Quantum mechanics was developed
independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg
and Erwin Schrédinger. Here, however, we
shall be discussing the quantum mechanics
which is based on the ideas of wave motion.
The fundamental equation of quantum
mechanics was developed by Schrédinger
and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in
1933. This equation which incorporates wave-
particle duality of matter as proposed by de
Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of
higher mathematics is needed to solve it. You
will learn its solutions for different systems
in higher classes.

For a system (such as an atom ora
molecule whose energy does not change with
time) the Schrodinger equation is written
as HW= EW where is a mathematical
operator called Hamiltonian. Schrédinger
gave a recipe of constructing this operator
from the expression for the total energy of
the system. The total energy of the system
takes into account the kinetic energies of all
the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei),
attractive potential between the electrons
and nuclei and repulsive potential among the
electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of
this equation gives E and y.

Hydrogen Atom and the Schrodinger
Equation

When Schrédinger equation is solved for
hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible
energy levels the electron can occupy and
the corresponding wave function(s) (y) of
the electron associated with each energy
level. These quantized energy states and
corresponding wave functions which are
characterized by a set of three quantum
numbers (principal quantum number
n, azimuthal quantum number / and
magnetic quantum number m,) arise as a
natural consequence in the solution of the
Schrédinger equation. When an electron
is in any energy state, the wave function

Reprint 2025-26

9/9/2022 4:28:17 PM

Unit 2.indd 54

54

corresponding to that energy state contains
all information about the electron. The wave
function is a mathematical function whose
value depends upon the coordinates of the
electron in the atom and does not carry any
physical meaning. Such wave functions of
hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one
electron are called atomic orbitals. Such
wave functions pertaining to one-electron
species are called one-electron systems. The
probability of finding an electron at a point
within an atom is proportional to the | y|’ at
that point. The quantum mechanical results
of the hydrogen atom successfully predict
all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum
including some phenomena that could not be
explained by the Bohr model.

Application of Schrédinger equation to
multi-electron atoms presents a difficulty: the
Schrédinger equation cannot be solved exactly
for a multi-electron atom. This difficulty can
be overcome by using approximate methods.
Such calculations with the aid of modern
computers show that orbitals in atoms other
than hydrogen do not differ in any radical
way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed
above. The principal difference lies in the
consequence of increased nuclear charge.
Because of this all the orbitals are somewhat
contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in
subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals
of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose
energies depend only on the quantum number
n, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron
atoms depend on quantum numbers n and lL.

Important Features of the Quantum
Mechanical Model of Atom

Quantum mechanical model of atom is
the picture of the structure of the atom,
which emerges from the application of
the Schrédinger equation to atoms. The
following are the important features of the
quantum-mechanical model of atom:

1. The energy of electrons in atoms is
quantized (i.e., can only have certain
specific values), for example when
electrons are bound to the nucleus in
atoms.

CHEMISTRY

2. The existence of quantised electronic
energy levels is a direct result of the
wave like properties of electrons and
are allowed solutions of Schrédinger
wave equation.

3. Both the exact position and exact
velocity of an electron in an atom
cannot be determined simultaneously
(Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The
path of an electron in an atom therefore,
can never be determined or known
accurately. That is why, as you shall see
later on, one talks of only probability of
finding the electron at different points in
an atom.

4. An atomic orbital is the wave
function y for an electron in an atom.
Whenever an electron is described
by a wave function, we say that the
electron occupies that orbital. Since
many such wave functions are possible
for an electron, there are many atomic
orbitals in an atom. These “one electron
orbital wave functions” or orbitals form
the basis of the electronic structure
of atoms. In each orbital, the electron
has a definite energy. An orbital cannot
contain more than two electrons. Ina
multi-electron atom, the electrons are
filled in various orbitals in the order of
increasing energy. For each electron
of a multi-electron atom, there shall,
therefore, be an orbital wave function
characteristic of the orbital it occupies.
All the information about the electron
in an atom is stored in its orbital wave
function y and quantum mechanics
makes it possible to extract this
information out of y.

5. The probability of finding an electron at
a point within an atom is proportional to
the square of the orbital wave function
i.e., |y|? at that point. | y|? is known
as probability density and is always
positive. From the value of | y|? at
different points within an atom,
it is possible to predict the region
around the nucleus where electron
will most probably be found.

2.6.1 Orbitals and Quantum Numbers

A large number of orbitals are possible in
an atom. Qualitatively these orbitals can

Reprint 2025-26

9/9/2022 4:28:17 PM

Unit 2.indd 55

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

be distinguished by their size, shape and
orientation. An orbital of smaller size means
there is more chance of finding the electron
near the nucleus. Similarly shape and
orientation mean that there is more probability
of finding the electron along certain directions
than along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely
distinguished by what are known as quantum
numbers. Each orbital is designated by three
quantum numbers labelled as n, land m.,

The principal quantum number ‘n’ is a
positive integer with value of n = 1,2,3.......
The principal quantum number determines
the size and to large extent the energy of the
orbital. For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like
species (He’*, Li**, .... etc.) energy and size of
the orbital depends only on ‘n’.

The principal quantum number also
identifies the shell. With the increase in the
value of ‘n’, the number of allowed orbital
increases and are given by ‘n”’ All the
orbitals of a given value of ‘n’ constitute
a single shell of atom and are represented
by the following letters

n=12 3 4
Shell= K LM N............

Size of an orbital increases with increase of
principal quantum number ‘n’. In other words
the electron will be located away from the
nucleus. Since energy is required in shifting
away the negatively charged electron from the
positively charged nucleus, the energy of the
orbital will increase with increase of n.

Azimuthal quantum number. ‘I’ is also
known as orbital angular momentum or
subsidiary quantum number. It defines the
three-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a
given value of n, 1 can have n values ranging
from 0 to n- 1, that is, for a given value of n,
the possible value of lare: 1= 0, 1, 2, ..........
(n-1)

For example, when n= 1, value of lis only
O. For n= 2, the possible value of | can be 0
and 1. For n= 3, the possible / values are 0,
1 and 2.

Each shell consists of one or more
sub-shells or sub-levels. The number of

55

sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the
value of n. For example in the first shell (n= 1),
there is only one sub-shell which corresponds

Electron spin ‘s’ : The three quantum
numbers labelling an atomic orbital can be
used equally well to define its energy, shape
and orientation. But all these quantum
numbers are not enough to explain the line
spectra observed in the case of multi-electron
atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur
in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets
(three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests
the presence of a few more energy levels than
predicted by the three quantum numbers.

In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel
Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth
quantum number known as the electron
spin quantum number (m,). An electron
spins around its own axis, much in a similar
way as earth spins around its own axis while
revolving around the sun. In other words,
an electron has, besides charge and mass,
intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin

angular momentum of the electron — a vector
quantity, can have two orientations relative to
the chosen axis. These two orientations are
distinguished by the spin quantum numbers
m, which can take the values of +’ or —A.
These are called the two spin states of the
electron and are normally represented by
two arrows, 7 (spin up) and ¥ (spin down). Two
electrons that have different m, values (one +’
and the other —’4) are said to have opposite
spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two
electrons and these two electrons should have
opposite spins.
To sum up, the four quantum numbers

provide the following information :
i) n defines the shell, determines the size

of the orbital and also to a large extent

the energy of the orbital.

ii) There are n subshells in the n® shell. 1
identifies the subshell and determines
the shape of the orbital (see section
2.6.2). There are (21+1) orbitals of each
type in a subshell, that is, one s orbital
(1 = O), three p orbitals (1 = 1) and five
d orbitals (1 = 2) per subshell. To some
extent | also determines the energy of
the orbital in a multi-electron atom.

iii) m, designates the orientation of the
orbital. For a given value of 1, m, has
(21+1) values, the same as the number
of orbitals per subshell. It means that

Orbit, orbital and its importance

Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the
nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible
according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and
their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand,
is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function yin an atom. It is
characterized by three quantum numbers (n, land m) and its value depends upon the coordinates
of the electron. yhas, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave functioni.e., | y|?
which has a physical meaning. | y|? at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density
at that point. Probability density (| y|?) is the probability per unit volume and the product of | y|?
and a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that
volume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that | y|? varies from one region to
another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element).
The total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum
of all the products of | w|? and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the
probable distribution of an electron in an orbital.

the number of orbitals is equal to the
number of ways in which they are
oriented.

iv) m, refers to orientation of the spin of the
electron.

2.6.2 Shapes of Atomic Orbitals

The orbital wave function or ywfor an electron
in an atom has no physical meaning. It
is simply a mathematical function of the
coordinates of the electron. However, for
different orbitals the plots of corresponding
wave functions as a function of r(the distance
from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a),
gives such plots for 1s (n = 1, l= 0) and 2s
(n = 2, l= O) orbitals.

probability density w?(r) as a function

nucleus for Is and 2s orbitals.

According to the German physicist,
Max Born, the square of the wave function
(i.e.,y’) at a point gives the probability density
of the electron at that point. The variation
of w’ as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals
is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may
note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals
are different.

It may be noted that for 1s orbital the
probability density is maximum at the
nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move
away from it. On the other hand, for 2s
orbital the probability density first decreases
sharply to zero and again starts increasing.
After reaching a small maxima it decreases
again and approaches zero as the value of
r increases further. The region where this
probability density function reduces to zero
is called nodal surfaces or simply nodes.
In general, it has been found that ns-orbital
has (n- 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes
increases with increase of principal quantum
number n. In other words, number of nodes
for 2s orbital is one, two for 3s and so on.

These probability density variation can be
visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams
[Fig. 2.13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density

of the dots in a region represents electron
probability density in that region.

Boundary surface diagrams of constant
probability density for different orbitals give
a fairly good representation of the shapes
of the orbitals. In this representation, a
boundary surface or contour surface is
drawn in space for an orbital on which the
value of probability density | Y|? is constant.
In principle many such boundary surfaces
may be possible. However, for a given
orbital, only that boundary surface diagram
of constant probability density* is taken to
be good representation of the shape of the
orbital which encloses a region or volume in
which the probability of finding the electron
is very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface
diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals are given in
Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why
do we not draw a boundary surface diagram,
which bounds a region in which the probability
of finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer
to this question is that the probability density
|Y|* has always some value, howsoever
small it may be, at any finite distance from
the nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to
draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid
size in which the probability of finding the
electron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram
for a s orbital is actually a sphere centred on
the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere
looks like a circle. It encloses a region in
which probability of finding the electron is
about 90%.

Thus, we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are
spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals
are spherically symmetric, that is, the
probability of finding the electron at a given
distance is equal in all the directions. It is also
observed that the size of the s orbital increases
with increase in n, that is, 4s >3s>2s>I1s
and the electron is located further away from
the nucleus as the principal quantum number
increases.

Boundary surface diagrams for three
2p orbitals (l= 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In

Here, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface

lobes touch each other. The size, shape and
energy of the three orbitals are identical.
They differ however, in the way the lobes are
oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to
lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the
designations 2p,, 2p» and 2p.. It should be
understood, however, that there is no simple
relation between the values of m, (-1, Oand +1)
and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose,

it is sufficient to remember that, because
there are three possible values of m, there
are, therefore, three p orbitals whose axes
are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals,
p orbitals increase in size and energy with
increase in the principal quantum number
and hence the order of the energy and size of
various p orbitals is 4p > 3p > 2p. Further, like
s orbitals, the probability density functions for
p-orbital also pass through value zero, besides
at zero and infinite distance, as the distance
from the nucleus increases. The number of
nodes are given by the n-2, that is number
of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, two for 4p
orbital and so on.

For 1= 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital
and the minimum value of principal quantum
number (n) has to be 3. as the value of /cannot
be greater than n-1. There are five m, values
(-2, -1, 0, +1 and +2) for /= 2 and thus there
are five d orbitals. The boundary surface
diagram of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15.

The five d-orbitals are designated as d,,,
d,,, d,,5 A22 and d». The shapes of the first
four d-orbitals are similar to each other, where
as that of the fifth one, d», is different from
others, but all five 3d orbitals are equivalent
in energy. The d orbitals for which nis greater
than 3 (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to
3d orbital, but differ in energy and size.

Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability
density function is zero), the probability
density functions for the np and nd orbitals
are zero at the plane (s), passing through the
nucleus (origin). For example, in case of p,
orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of
d_ orbital, there are two nodal planes passing
through the origin and bisecting the xy plane
containing z-axis. These are called angular
nodes and number of angular nodes are given
by ‘, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two
angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on. The
total number of nodes are given by (n-1),
i.e., sum of | angular nodes and (n- 1-1)
radial nodes.

is determined solely by the principal quantum

number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in
hydrogen atom increases as follows :

ls < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d <4s = 4p = 4d
= 4f< (2.23)
and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the
shapes of 2s and 2p orbitals are different,
an electron has the same energy when it is
in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p
orbital. The orbitals having the same energy
are called degenerate. The 1s orbital in a
hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds
to the most stable condition and is called the
ground state and an electron residing in this
orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus.
An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in
a hydrogen atom is in excited state.

and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that
orbitals for the same value of principal
quantum number, have the same
energies even for different azimuthal
quantum number for hydrogen atom.
In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals
with same principal quantum number
possess different energies for different
azimuthal quantum numbers.

CHEMISTRY

The energy of an electron in a multi-
electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen
atom, depends not only on its principal
quantum number (shell), but also on its
azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That
is, for a given principal quantum number, s,
p, ad, f... all have different energies. Within
a given principal quantum number, the
energy of orbitals increases in the order
s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these
differences are sufficiently pronounced and
straggering of orbital energy may result,
e.g., 4s<3d and 6s<5d; 4f<6p. The main
reason for having different energies of the
subshells is the mutual repulsion among the
electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only
electrical interaction present in hydrogen
atom is the attraction between the negatively
charged electron and the positively charged
nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the
presence of attraction between the electron
and nucleus, there are repulsion terms
between every electron and other electrons
present in the atom. Thus the stability of an
electron in a multi-electron atom is because
total attractive interactions are more than
the repulsive interactions. In general, the
repulsive interaction of the electrons in the
outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell
are more important. On the other hand, the
attractive interactions of an electron increases
with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the
nucleus. Due to the presence of electrons in
the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell
will not experience the full positive charge of
the nucleus (Ze). The effect will be lowered
due to the partial screening of positive charge
on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons.
This is known as the shielding of the outer
shell electrons from the nucleus by the
inner shell electrons, and the net positive
charge experienced by the outer electrons is
known as effective nuclear charge (Z.,. ¢).
Despite the shielding of the outer electrons
from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons,
the attractive force experienced by the outer
shell electrons increases with increase of
nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of
interaction between, the nucleus and electron

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

(that is orbital energy) decreases (that is
more negative) with the increase of atomic
number (Z).

Both the attractive and repulsive
interactions depend upon the shell and shape
of the orbital in which the electron is present.
For example electrons present in spherical
shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons
from the nucleus more effectively as compared
to electrons present in p orbital. Similarly
electrons present in p orbitals shield the outer
electrons from the nucleus more than the
electrons present in d orbitals, even though all
these orbitals are present in the same shell.
Further within a shell, due to spherical shape
of s orbital, the s orbital electron spends more
time close to the nucleus in comparison to p
orbital electron which spends more time in
the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d
orbital electron. In other words, for a given
shell (principal quantum number), the Z,,,
experienced by the electron decreases with
increase of azimuthal quantum number (J),
that is, the s orbital electron will be more
tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital
electron which in turn will be better tightly
bound than the d orbital electron. The energy
of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more
negative) than that of p orbital electron
which will have less energy than that of d
orbital electron and so on. Since the extent
of shielding from the nucleus is different for
electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the
splitting of energy levels within the same
shell (or same principal quantum number),
that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as
mentioned earlier, depends upon the values
of n and Il. Mathematically, the dependence
of energies of the orbitals on n and lare quite
complicated but one simple rule is that, the
lower the value of (n+ J) for an orbital, the
lower is its energy. If two orbitals have
the same value of (n + I), the orbital with
lower value of n will have the lower energy.
The Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + 1) rule and
Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-
electrons atoms. It may be noted that different
subshells of a particular shell have different
energies in case of multi-electrons atoms.
However, in hydrogen atom, these have the

same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here
that energies of the orbitals in the same
subshell decrease with increase in the
atomic number (Z,,,). For example, energy of
2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than
that of 2s orbital of lithium and that of lithium
is greater than that of sodium and so on, that
is, E, (H) > E,(Li) > E,,(Na) > E,(K).

2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in Atom

The filling of electrons into the orbitals of
different atoms takes place according to
the aufbau principle which is based on the
Pauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule
of maximum multiplicity and the relative
energies of the orbitals.

Aufbau Principle

The word ‘aufbaw’ in German means ‘building
up’. The building up of orbitals means the

Reprint 2025-26

9/9/2022 4:28:20 PM

Unit 2.indd 62

62

filling up of orbitals with electrons. The
principle states : In the ground state of the
atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of
their increasing energies. In other words,
electrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital
available to them and enter into higher energy
orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals
are filled. As you have learnt above, energy
of a given orbital depends upon effective
nuclear charge and different type of orbitals
are affected to different extent. Thus, there
is no single ordering of energies of orbitals
which will be universally correct for all atoms.

However, following order of energies of
the orbitals is extremely useful:
ls, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s,
4f, Sd, Op, 7s...

The order may be remembered by using
the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from

Fig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitals

CHEMISTRY

the top, the direction of the arrows gives the
order of filling of orbitals, that is starting
from right top to bottom left. With respect to
placement of outermost valence electrons,
it is remarkably accurate for all atoms. For
example, valence electron in potassium
must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and
as predicted by this sequence, it is found
in 4s orbital. The above order should be
assumed to be a rough guide to the filling
of energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals
are similar in energy and small changes in
atomic structure may bring about a change
in the order of filling. Even then, the above
series is a useful guide to the building of the
electronic structure of an atom provided that
it is remembered that exceptions may occur.

Pauli Exclusion Principle

The number of electrons to be filled in various
orbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle,
given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli
(1926). According to this principle : No two
electrons in an atom can have the same set
of four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion
principle can also be stated as : “Only two
electrons may exist in the same orbital and
these electrons must have opposite spin.”
This means that the two electrons can have
the same value of three quantum numbers
n, land m, but must have the opposite spin
quantum number. The restriction imposed
by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number
of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating
the capacity of electrons to be present in any
subshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises
one orbital and thus the maximum number of
electrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in
p and d subshells, the maximum number of
electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can
be summed up as : the maximum number
of electrons in the shell with principal
quantum number n is equal to 2n’.

Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity

This rule deals with the filling of electrons into
the orbitals belonging to the same subshell
(that is, orbitals of equal energy, called
degenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

electrons in the orbitals belonging to the
same subshell (p, d or f) does not take
place until each orbital belonging to that
subshell has got one electron each i.e., it
is singly occupied.

Since there are three p, five d and seven f
orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will
start in the p, d and forbitals with the entry
of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It
has been observed that half filled and fully
filled degenerate set of orbitals acquire extra
stability due to their symmetry (see Section,
2.6.7).

2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of Atoms

The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an
atom is called its electronic configuration.
If one keeps in mind the basic rules which
govern the filling of different atomic orbitals,
the electronic configurations of different
atoms can be written very easily.

The electronic configuration of different
atoms can be represented in two ways. For
example :

(i) s*p’d...... notation
(ii) Orbital diagram
| ee a
S 2) d

In the first notation, the subshell is
represented by the respective letter symbol
and the number of electrons present in the
subshell is depicted, as the super script, like
a, b,c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented
for different shells is differentiated by writing
the principal quantum number before the
respective subshell. In the second notation
each orbital of the subshell is represented
by a box and the electron is represented by
an arrow (t) a positive spin or an arrow (J)
a negative spin. The advantage of second
notation over the first is that it represents all
the four quantum numbers.

The hydrogen atom has only one electron
which goes in the orbital with the lowest energy,
namely 1s. The electronic configuration of the
hydrogen atom is 1s! meaning that it has
one electron in the 1s orbital. The second
electron in helium (He) can also occupy the

Oo
w

1s orbital. Its configuration is, therefore, 1s?.
As mentioned above, the two electrons differ
from each other with opposite spin, as can be
seen from the orbital diagram.

H He
1s Is

The third electron of lithium (Li) is not
allowed in the 1s orbital because of Pauli
exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the
next available choice, namely the 2s orbital.
The electronic configuration of Li is 1s?2s'.
The 2s orbital can accommodate one more
electron. The configuration of beryllium (Be)
atom is, therefore, 1s* 2s? (see Table 2.6,
page 66 for the electronic configurations of
elements).

In the next six elements—boron
(B, 1s?2s?2p'), carbon (C, 1s?2s?2p’), nitrogen
(N, 1s°2s?2p°*), oxygen (O, 1s°2s?2p’‘), fluorine
(F, 1s?2s?2p°) and neon (Ne, 1s?2s?2p°), the 2p
orbitals get progressively filled. This process
is completed with the neon atom. The orbital
picture of these elements can be represented
as follows :

The electronic configuration of the
elements sodium (Na, 1s?2s?2p°3s') to argon
(Ar, 1s?2s?2p°3s°3p°), follow exactly the same
pattern as the elements from lithium to neon
with the difference that the 3s and 3p orbitals
are getting filled now. This process can be
simplified if we represent the total number
of electrons in the first two shells by the
name of element neon (Ne). The electronic
configuration of the elements from sodium to

Unit 2.indd 64

64

argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3s’) to (Ar,
[Ne] 3s?3p°). The electrons in the completely
filled shells are known as core electrons and
the electrons that are added to the electronic
shell with the highest principal quantum
number are called valence electrons. For
example, the electrons in Ne are the core
electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are
the valence electrons. In potassium (K) and
calcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in
energy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by
one and two electrons respectively.

A new pattern is followed beginning with
scandium (Sc). The 3d orbital, being lower
in energy than the 4p orbital, is filled first.
Consequently, in the next ten elements,
scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V),
chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe),
cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc
(Zn), the five 3d orbitals are progressively
occupied. We may be puzzled by the fact
that chromium and copper have five and ten
electrons in 3d orbitals rather than four and
nine as their position would have indicated
with two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The
reason is that fully filled orbitals and half-
filled orbitals have extra stability (that is,
lower energy). Thus p’, p®°, d°, d'°,f’, f* ete.
configurations, which are either half-filled
or fully filled, are more stable. Chromium
and copper therefore adopt the d° and
d’° configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution:
exceptions do exist]

With the saturation of the 3d orbitals,
the filling of the 4p orbital starts at gallium
(Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the
next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb)
to xenon (Xe), the pattern of filling the 5s,
4d and 5p orbitals are similar to that of 4s,
3d and 4p orbitals as discussed above. Then
comes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium
(Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains
one and two electrons, respectively. Then from
lanthanum (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up
of electrons takes place in 4fand 5d orbitals.

CHEMISTRY

After this, filling of 6p, then 7s and finally 5f
and 6d orbitals takes place. The elements
after uranium (U) are all short-lived and all of
them are produced artificially. The electronic
configurations of the known elements (as
determined by spectroscopic methods) are
tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66).

One may ask what is the utility of knowing
the electron configuration? The modern
approach to the chemistry, infact, depends
almost entirely on electronic distribution to
understand and explain chemical behaviour.
For example, questions like why two or more
atoms combine to form molecules, why some
elements are metals while others are non-
metals, why elements like helium and argon
are not reactive but elements like the halogens
are reactive, find simple explanation from the
electronic configuration. These questions have
no answer in the Daltonian model of atom.
A detailed understanding of the electronic
structure of atom is, therefore, very essential
for getting an insight into the various aspects
of modern chemical knowledge.

2.6.6, Stability of Completely Filled and
Half Filled Subshells

The ground state electronic configuration of
the atom of an element always corresponds to
the state of the lowest total electronic energy.
The electronic configurations of most of the
atoms follow the basic rules given in Section
2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as
Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and
3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron
shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s) toa
subshell of higher energy (3d), provided such
a shift results in all orbitals of the subshell
of higher energy getting either completely
filled or half filled. The valence electronic
configurations of Cr and Cu, therefore, are
3d°4s' and 3d'°4s! respectively and not 3d*
4s? and 3d’ 4s’. It has been found that there is
extra stability associated with these electronic
configurations.

Causes of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells

The completely filled and completely
half-filled subshells are stable due to the
following reasons:
1.Symmetrical distribution of
electrons: It is well known that symmetry
leads to stability. The completely filled
or half filled subshells have symmetrical
distribution of electrons in them and
are therefore more stable. Electrons in
the same subshell (here 3d) have equal
energy but different spatial distribution.
Consequently, their shielding of one-
another is relatively small and the
electrons are more strongly attracted by
the nucleus.
2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing
effect arises whenever two or more
electrons with the same spin are present
in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.
These electrons tend to exchange their
positions and the energy released due to
this exchange is called exchange energy.
The number of exchanges that can take
place is maximum when the subshell
is either half filled or completely filled
(Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange
energy is maximum and so is the stability.
You may note that the exchange
energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule
that electrons which enter orbitals of
equal energy have parallel spins as far
as possible. In other words, the extra
stability of half-filled and completely filled
subshell is due to: (i) relatively small
shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion
energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.
Details about the exchange energy will be
dealt with in higher classes.

CHEMISTRY

SUMMARY

Atoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that
chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as
the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was
proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles:
electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal
of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.

Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity
with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to
be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle
scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively
charged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits.
Rutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over
Thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron
does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of
atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The
difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the
hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits.
Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated
the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the
electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the
spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The
reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged
particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of
the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can
completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron
at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour
of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Erwin Schrédinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrédinger equation to
describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This
equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrédinger equation is solved for the electron in a
hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and
the corresponding wave function(s) (y) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the
electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding
wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal
quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number / and magnetic quantum number m)
arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrédinger equation. The restrictions
on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The
quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the
hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the
Bohr model.

According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an
atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought
to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or
more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems
(such as He’, Li** etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of
the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of nand lL: The lower the value
of (n + 1) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + 1) value,
the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are

possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance
with Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four
quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the
orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to
that subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the
electronic structure of atoms.
