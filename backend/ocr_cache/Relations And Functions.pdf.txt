RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

2.1 Introduction

Much of mathematics is about finding a pattern — a
recognisable link between quantities that change. In our
daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise
relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher
and student. In mathematics also, we come across many
relations such as number m is less than number n, line /is
parallel to line m, set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we
notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain
order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of
objects from two sets and then introduce relations between
the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about G.W. Leibnitz
special relations which will qualify to be functions. The (1646-1716)
concept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a
mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other.

2.2 Cartesian Products.of Sets

Suppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e.,
A = {red, blue}and B = {b, c, s},

where b, c and s represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively.
How many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets?

Proceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6
distinct pairs as given below:

(red, b), (red, c), (red, s), (blue, 5), (blue, c), (blue, s). b
Thus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1). . red blue
Let us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements Fig 2.1

taken from any two sets P and Q is a pair of elements written in small

brackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., (p,g), p € Pand gq € Q. This
leads to the following definition:

Definition 1 Given two non-empty sets P and Q. The cartesian product P x Q is the
set of all ordered pairs of elements from P and Q, i.e.,

PxQ={(@q):P €Pq €Q}
If either P or Q is the null set, then P x Q will also be empty set, i.e., Px Q=0

From the illustration given above we note that

A x B= {(red,b), (red,c), (red,s), (blue,b), (blue,c), (blue,s)}.

Again, consider the two sets:

A= {DL, MP, KA}, where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi,

Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and B = {01,02, 03
03}representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued 92
by DL, MP and KA . 01

If the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka
were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, withthe DL MP KA
restriction that the code begins with an element from set A,
which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such
pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)?

The available pairs are:(DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP,03),
(KA,01), (KA,02), (KA,03) and the product of set A and set B is given by
Ax B= {(DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP,03), (KA,01), (KA,02),

(KA,03)}.

It can easily be seen that there will be 9 such pairs in the Cartesian product, since
there are 3 elements in each of the sets A and B. This gives us 9 possible codes. Also
note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code
(DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL).

As a final illustration, consider the two sets A= {a,, a,} and b,

B= {b,, b,, b,, b,} (Fig 2.3). b,

AxB= {(a, 5,), (4, 5,), (a,, 53), (4, 54), (455 5), (a, 5,), B,

(4), b,), (dy b,)}- by
The 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in
the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is =a, a,
obvious that the point in the position (a,, b,) will be distinct from the point
in the position (5,, a,).

Remarks

(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements
are equal and the second elements are also equal.

(ii) If there are p elements in A and gq elements in B, then there will be pg
elements in A x B,ie., if m(A) = p and n(B) =q, then n(A x B) = pg.

(iii) IfA and B are non-empty sets and either A or B is an infinite set, then so is
A XB.

(iv) Ax Ax A= {(a, b,c): a,b,c € A}. Here (a, b, c) is called an ordered
triplet.

Example 1 If (x+ 1, y—2)=@,1), find the values of x and y.

Solution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal.
Therefore x+1=3 andy—-2=1.
Solving weget x=2andy=3.

Example 2 If P= {a, b, c} and Q = {r}, form the sets P x Q and Q x P.
Are these two products equal?

Solution By the definition of the cartesian product,
PxXQ= {(a,r), (6,7), (¢,r)} and Qx P= {(r, a), (7, ), (7, ©)
Since, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair (a, ) is not equal to the pair
(r, a), we conclude that Px Q#Q*xP.
However, the number of elements in each set will be the same.
Example 3 Let A= {1,2,3}, B= {3,4} and C = {4,5,6}. Find
G@) Ax(BOC) (ii) (Ax B)AN(A xC)
(ii) Ax (BUC) (iv) (Ax B)U(A xC)
Solution (i) By the definition of the intersection of two sets, (B ~ C) = {4}.
Therefore, A x (BM C) = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}.
(ii) Now (A x B)= {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3.4)}
and (A x C)= {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3.4), (3,5), (3,6)
Therefore, (A x B)N(AxC) = {(1, 4), (2, 4), GB, 4}.
(iii) Since, (BUC) = {3, 4, 5, 6}, we have
Ax (BUC) = {(1,3), (1,4), 1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3),
(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}.
(iv) Using the sets A x B and A x C from part (ii) above, we obtain
(A x B) U(A x C) = £{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),
(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}-

Example 4 If P = {1, 2}, form the set P x P x P.

(2,2,2)}.

Example 5 If R is the set of all real numbers, what do the cartesian products R x R
and R x R x R represent?

Solution The Cartesian product R x R represents the set R x R={(x, y): x, y € R}
which represents the coordinates of all the points in two dimensional space and the
cartesian product R x R x R represents the set R x R x R={(x, yz): x,y,z € R}
which represents the coordinates of all the points in three-dimensional space.

Example 6 IfA x B ={(p, q),(p, 7), (m, g), (m, r)}, find A and B.

2.3 Relations
Consider the two sets P= {a, b, c} and Q = {Ali, Bhanu, Binoy, Chandra, Divya}.
The cartesian product of P Q
P and Q has 15 ordered pairs which
can be listed as P x Q = {(a, Ali),
(a, Bhanu), (a, Binoy), ..., (c, Divya)}.
We can now obtain a subset of
P x Q by introducing a relation R
between the first element x and the
second element y of each ordered pair
(x, y) as
R= { (wy): x is the first letter of the name y, x € P, y € Q}.
Then R = {(a, Ali), (6, Bhanu), (6, Binoy), (c, Chandra) }
A visual representation of this relation R (called an arrow diagram) is shown

Definition 2 A relation R from a non-empty set A to a non-empty set B is a subset of
the cartesian product A x B. The subset is derived by describing a relationship between
the first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in A x B. The second
element is called the image of the first element.

Definition 3 The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R from a set
A to a set B is called the domain of the relation R.

Definition 4 The set of all second elements in a relation R from a set A to a set B is
called the range of the relation R. The whole set B is called the codomain of the
relation R. Note that range C codomain.

Remarks (i) A relation may be represented algebraically either by the Roster
method or by the Set-builder method.
(ii) An arrow diagram is a visual representation of a relation.

The domain of this relation is {4, 9, 25}.
The range of this relation is {— 2, 2, -3, 3, —-5, 5}.
Note that the element | is not related to any element in set P.

The set Q is the codomain of this relation.

he total number of relations that can be defined from a set A to a set B

is the number of possible subsets of A x B. If n(A ) = p and n(B) = q, then
n(A x B) =pq and the total number of relations is 2”.

Example 9 Let A= {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the number of relations from A to B.

Solution We have,

Ax B= {(1, 3), C1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4}.
Since n (AxB ) = 4, the number of subsets of AxB is 2*. Therefore, the number of
relations from A into B will be 2+.

2.4 Functions

In this Section, we study a special type of relation called function. It is one of the most
important concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces
new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as ‘map’ or
‘mapping’ used to denote a function.

Definition 5 A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be a function if every
element of set A has one and only one image in set B.

In other words, a function fis a relation from a non-empty set A to a non-empty
set B such that the domain of fis A and no two distinct ordered pairs in f have the
same first element.

If fis a function from A to B and (a, b) € f then f(a) = b, where b is called the
image of a under f and a is called the preimage of b under f.

Reprint 2025-26

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 31

The function ffrom A to B is denoted by f A > B.
Looking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is
not a function because the element 6 has no image.

Again, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the
domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is
also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more
relations some of which are functions and others are not.

Example 10 Let N be the set of natural numbers and the relation R be defined on
N such that R= {(x, y): y= 2x, x, y € N}.
What is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function?

Solution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N.
The range is the set of even natural numbers.

Since every natural number 7 has one and only one image, this relation is a
function.

Example 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each
case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not?
(i) R= {(2,1),G,1), (4,2)}, GD R= {(2,2),(2,4),(3,3), (4.45
(iii) R= {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)}

Solution @) Since 2,3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images,
this relation R is a function.
(ii) Since the same first element 2 corresponds to two different images 2
and 4, this relation is not a function.
(iti) Since every element has one and only one image, this relation is a
function.

Definition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called
a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is
called a real function.

Example 12 Let N be the set of natural numbers. Define a real valued function

f: NON by f(x) = 2x + 1. Using this definition, complete the table given below.

functions, subtract a real function from another, multiply a real function by a scalar
(here by a scalar we mean a real number), multiply two real functions and divide one

(i) Addition of two real functions Let f: X — R and g: X > R be any two real

Example 19 Let R be a relation from Q to Q defined by R = {(a,b): a,b € Q and
a—b € Z}. Show that

(i) (aa) €¢ R forallae Q

(ii) (a,b) € R implies that (6, a) e R

(iti) (a,b) € R and (4,c) € R implies that (a,c) ER

Solution (a) Since,a—a=0 € Z, if follows that (a, a) € R.
(ii) (a,b) € R implies that a- 6b € Z. So, b- a € Z. Therefore,
(bayeR
(iti) (a, b) and (b,c) € Rimplies thata—b e¢ Z.b-ceZ. So,
a—c=(a—b)+ (6-c) € Z. Therefore, (a,c) e R

Example 20 Let f= {(,1), (2,3), (0, -1), (-1, -3)} be a linear function from Z into Z.
Find f(x).

Solution Since fis a linear function, f(x) = mx +c. Also, since (1, 1), (0,-—1) € R,
fQ)=m+c=1 and f(0) =c =-1. This gives m = 2 and f(x) = 2x - 1.

Solution Sincex —Sx+4= (x — 4) (x=1), the function fis defined for all real numbers
except at x = 4 and x = 1. Hence the domain of fis R— {1, 4}.

Summary

In this Chapter, we studied about relations and functions.The main features of
this Chapter are as follows:
© Ordered pair A pair of elements grouped together in a particular order.
® Cartesian product A x B of two sets A and B is given by
Ax B= {(a,b):a¢A,b eB}
In particular R x R= {(x, y): x,y € R}
and Rx Rx R= {(x, y, Z): x,y, z € R}
© If (a, b) = (x, y), then a =x and b=}.
© If n(A) = p and n(B) = gq, then n(A x B) = pq.
eAXxO=0
® In general, Ax B4#BX A.

® Relation A relation R from a set A to a set B is a subset of the cartesian
product A x B obtained by describing a relationship between the first element
x and the second element y of the ordered pairs in A x B.

® The image of an element x under a relation R is given by y, where (x, y) € R,

® The domain of R is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a
relation R.

® The range of the relation R is the set of all second elements of the ordered
pairs in a relation R.

® Function A function f from a set A to a set B is a specific type of relation for
which every element x of set A has one and only one image y in set B.

We write f AB, where f(x) = y.
® A is the domain and B is the codomain of f:

® The range of the function is the set of images.

® A real function has the set of real numbers or one of its subsets both as its
domain and as its range.

® Algebra of functions For functions f: X — R and g: X > R, we have
(f+ g) (x) = f(x) + g(x), x € X
(f— g) (x) =f) — g(x), x € X

Historical/Note

The word FUNCTION first appears in a Latin manuscript “Methodus
tangentium inversa, seu de fuctionibus” written by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz
(1646-1716) in 1673; Leibnitz used the word in the non-analytical sense. He
considered a function in terms of “mathematical job” — the “employee” being
Just a curve.

On July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time
deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical
sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval.

Function is found in English in 1779 in Chambers’ Cyclopaedia: “The
term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded
of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities”.
