1.1 Introduction

The concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the
present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used
in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to
define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of
geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge
of sets.

The theory of sets was developed by German
mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first
encountered sets while working on “problems on trigonometric
series”. In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions
and operations involving sets.

1.2 Sets and their Representations

In everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as,
a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come
across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More
specially, we examine the following collections:
(i) Odd natural numbers less than 10, ie., 1, 3,5, 7,9

(ii) The rivers of India

(itt) The vowels in the English alphabet, namely, a, e, i, 0, u

(iv) Various kinds of triangles

(v) Prime factors of 210, namely, 2,3,5 and 7

(vi) The solution of the equation: x’— 5x + 6 = 0, viz, 2 and 3.

We note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in

Reprint 2025-26

2 MATHEMATICS

the sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a
given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to
the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this
colleciton.

We give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz.

N_ : the set of all natural numbers

Z_: the set of all integers

Q : the set of all rational numbers

R_: the set of real numbers

Z* : the set of positive integers

Q‘ : the set of positive rational numbers, and

R* : the set of positive real numbers.

The symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout
this text.

Again the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not
well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned
may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection.

We shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects.

The following points may be noted :

(i) Objects, elements and members of a set are synonymous terms.
(ii) Sets are usually denoted by capital letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.
(it) The elements of a set are represented by small letters a, b, c, x, y, z, etc.

If ais an element of a set A, we say that “ a belongs to A” the Greek symbol €
(epsilon) is used to denote the phrase ‘belongs to’. Thus, we write a € A. If ‘b’ is not
an element of a set A, we write b ¢ A and read “b does not belong to A”.

Thus, in the set V of vowels in the English alphabet, a € V but b ¢ V. In the set
P of prime factors of 30,3 € P but 15 ¢ P.

There are two methods of representing a set :
(i) Roster or tabular form
(ii) Set-builder form.

(i) Inroster form, all the elements ofa set are listed, the elements are being separated
by commas and are enclosed within braces { }. For example, the set of all even
positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as {2, 4, 6}. Some more
examples of representing a set in roster form are given below :

(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}.

Reprint 2025-26

SETS 3

In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial.

Thus, the above set can also be represented as {1, 3, 7, 21, 2, 6, 14, 42}.
(b) The set of all vowels in the English alphabet is {a, e, i, 0, u}.
(c) The set of odd natural numbers is represented by {1, 3, 5, .. .}. The dots
tell us that the list of odd numbers continue indefinitely.
It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not
generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set

of letters forming the word ‘SCHOOL’ is { S, C, H, O, L} or {H, O, L, C, S}. Here,
the order of listing elements has no relevance.

(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property

which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set

{a, e, i, o, u}, all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them

is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possess this property. Denoting

this set by V, we write

V = {x : x is a vowel in English alphabet}

It may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol x
(any other symbol like the letters y, z, etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon
“:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the
elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above
description of the set V is read as “the set of all x such that x is a vowel of the English
alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for
“such that”. For example, the set

A= {x - xis anatural number and 3 <x < 10} is read as “the set of all x such that

x is anatural number and x lies between 3 and 10.” Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6,

7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set A.

If we denote the sets described in (a), (6) and (c) above in roster form by A, B,
C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows:

A= {x :x is a natural number which divides 42}

B= {y: yis a vowel in the English alphabet}

C= {z: zis an odd natural number}

Example 1 Write the solution set of the equation x?+ x — 2 = 0 in roster form.

Solution The given equation can be written as
(x-1) (®+2)=0,L¢e, x=1,-2
Therefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as {1,—2}.

Example 2 Write the set {x : x is a positive integer and x* < 40} in the roster form.

Reprint 2025-26

4 MATHEMATICS

Solution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the given set in the roster form
is {1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6}.

Example 3 Write the set A= {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... }in set-builder form.

Solution We may write the set A as
A= {x :x is the square of a natural number}
Alternatively, we can write
A= {x:x=n’, where n € N}
E le 4 Write th ee 2 Synth t-builder fi
xample Tite the set (>> 3+] 5° G7) in the set-builder form.
Solution We see that each member in the given set has the numerator one less than
the denominator. Also, the numerator begin from 1 and do not exceed 6. Hence, in the
set-builder form the given set is

{» Ix= — where nis a natural number and 1<n< sf
n+
Example 5 Match each of the set on the left described in the roster form with the
same set on the right described in the set-builder form :
(i) {P,R,I,N,C,A,L} (a) {x:x is a positive integer and is a divisor of 18}

(ii) {0} (b) { x: x is an integer and x*— 9 = 0}
(iii) {1,2,3,6,9, 18} (c) {x : x is an integer and x + 1= 1}
(iv) {3,-3} (d) {x : x is a letter of the word PRINCIPAL}

Solution Since in (d), there are 9 letters in the word PRINCIPAL and two letters P and I
are repeated, so (i) matches (d). Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as x + 1 = | implies
x=0. Also, 1, 2 ,3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a). Finally, x’— 9 =0
implies x = 3, —3 and so (iv) matches (b).

(iv) {1,3,5,7, 9} (d) {x:x isa letter of the word MATHEMATICS}.

1.3 The Empty Set

Consider the set

A={x:x isa student of Class XI presently studying in a school }
We can go to the school and count the number of students presently studying in

Class XI in the school. Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements.

We now write another set B as follows:

Reprint 2025-26

6 MATHEMATICS

B= {x:xisa student presently studying in both Classes X and XI }
We observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI.
Thus, the set B contains no element at all.

Definition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the
null set or the void set.
According to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The
empty set is denoted by the symbol or { }.
We give below a few examples of empty sets.
(i) Let A= {x:1<.x<2, x is a natural number}. Then A is the empty set,
because there is no natural number between | and 2.
(ii) B= {x:x’—2=0 and x is rational number}. Then B is the empty set because
the equation x°— 2 = 0 is not satisfied by any rational value of x.
(iti) C= {x :x is an even prime number greater than 2}.Then C is the empty set,
because 2 is the only even prime number.
(iv) D={x:x°=4, x is odd }. Then D is the empty set, because the equation
x’= 4 is not satisfied by any odd value of x.

1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets

Let A= {1, 2, 3,4, 5}, B={a4b,64d4 e g}

and C= { men living presently in different parts of the world}

We observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements
does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some
natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S,
we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by 7 (S). If (S)
is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set.

Consider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this
set is not finite since there are infinite number of natural numbers. We say that the set
of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets
and n(A) = 5, n(B) = 6 and n(C) = some finite number.

Definition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is
called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite.
Consider some examples :
(i) Let W be the set of the days of the week. Then W is finite.
(ii) Let S be the set of solutions of the equation x’-16 = 0. Then S is finite.
(iti) Let G be the set of points on a line. Then G is infinite.
When we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set
within braces { }. It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within
braces { } because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent

Reprint 2025-26

SETS 7

some infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the
structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots.

For example, {1,2,3...} is the set of natural numbers, {1, 3,5, 7,...} 1s the set
of odd natural numbers, {. . .—3, —2,—1, 0,1, 2 ,3,...} is the set of integers. All these
sets are infinite.

‘@ Note All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the

set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this
set do not follow any particular pattern.

Example 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite :
(i) {x:x € N and (x- 1) (x-2) = 0}
(ii) {x:x e Nand x? =4}
(iii) + {x:x € N and 2x-1 =0}
(iv) {x:x € N and x is prime}
(v) {x:x € Nand x is odd}
Solution (@) Given set = {1,2}. Hence, it is finite.
(ii) Given set = {2}. Hence, it is finite.
(iti) Given set = o. Hence, it is finite.
(iv) The given set is the set of all prime numbers and since set of prime
numbers is infinite. Hence the given set is infinite
(v) Since there are infinite number of odd numbers, hence, the given set is
infinite.
1.5 Equal Sets
Given two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every

element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal.
Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements.

Definition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same
elements and we write A = B. Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write
A+B.
We consider the following examples :
(i) Let A= {1, 2, 3,4} and B= {3, 1,4, 2}. Then A=B.
(ii) Let A be the set of prime numbers less than 6 and P the set of prime factors
of 30. Then A and P are equal, since 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime factors of
30 and also these are less than 6.

A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated.
For example, the sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 2, 1, 3, 3} are equal, since each

Reprint 2025-26

8 MATHEMATICS

element of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any
element in describing a set.

Example 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons:
A= {0}, B= {x:x>15andx<5},
C= {x:x-5=0}, D= {x: x= 25},
E= {x: x is an integral positive root of the equation x* — 2x —-15 = 0}.

Solution Since 0 € A and 0 does not belong to any of the sets B, C, D and E, it
follows that, A#B,A#C,A#D,AZE.

Since B = but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore B #C,B+#D
and B # E. Also C = {5} but —5 € D, hence C # D.

Since E = {5}, C=E. Further, D= {-5, 5} and E= {5}, we find that, D # E.
Thus, the only pair of equal sets is C and E.

Example 8 Which of the following pairs of sets are equal? Justify your answer.
(i) X, the set of letters in “ALLOY” and B, the set of letters in “LOYAL”.
(ii) A= {n:ne Zandn’ <4} and B= {x:x € R and x’— 3x +2 =0}.

Solution (i) We have, X = {A, L, L, O, Y}, B= {L, O, Y, A, L}. Then X and B are
equal sets as repetition of elements in a set do not change a set. Thus,

X= {A,L,0,Y}=B
(11) A= {-2,-1, 0, 1,2}, B= {1,2}. Since 0 € Aand 0 ¢ B, Aand B are not equal sets.

1.6 Subsets
Consider the sets : X = set of all students in your school, Y = set of all students in your
class.

We note that every element of Y is also an element of X; we say that Y is a subset
of X. The fact that Y is subset of X is expressed in symbols as Y c X. The symbol <
stands for ‘is a subset of’ or ‘is contained in’.

Definition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an
element of B.

In other words, A < B if whenever a € A, then a ¢€ B. It is often convenient to
use the symbol “=>” which means implies. Using this symbol, we can write the definiton
of subset as follows:

AcBifaeA>aeB

We read the above statement as “A is a subset of B if a is an element of A
implies that a is also an element of B”. If A is not a subset of B, we write A ¢ B.

We may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every
element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If
it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B CA. In this
case, A and B are the same sets so that we have AC BandBc A<A=B, where
“<>” 1s asymbol for two way implications, and is usually read as if'and only if (briefly
written as “iff’).

It follows from the above definition that every set A is a subset of itself, i.e.,
Ac A. Since the empty set has no elements, we agree to say that > is a subset of
every set. We now consider some examples :

(i) The set Q of rational numbers is a subset of the set R of real numbes, and
we write Q CR.
(ii) IfA is the set of all divisors of 56 and B the set of all prime divisors of 56,
then B is a subset of A and we write BCA.
(ii) LetA= {1, 3,5} and B= {x - xis an odd natural number less than 6}. Then
A cBand Bc A and hence A= B.
(iv) LetA={a ei, 0, u} andB= {a, b,c, d}. Then Ais not a subset of B,
also B is not a subset of A.
Let A and B be two sets. If Ac B and A#¥B,, then A is called a proper subset
of B and B 1s called superset of A. For example,
A= {1, 2, 3} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
If a set A has only one element, we call it a singleton set. Thus,{ a } is a
singleton set.
Example 9 Consider the sets
d6,A={1,3}, B= {1,5,9}, C= {1, 3,5, 7, 9}.

1.6.2 Intervals as subsets of R Leta, b € Randa < b. Then the set of real numbers
{y.:a<y <b} is called an open interval and is denoted by (a, 6). All the points
between a and b belong to the open interval (a, b) but a, b themselves do not belong to
this interval.

The interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is
denoted by [ a, b ]. Thus

[a b]={x:a<x<b}
We can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e.,

La, b)= {x:a<x<b} isan open interval from a to b, including a but excluding 5.

(a,b]={x:a<x< b} isan open interval from a to b including b but excluding a.

These notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of
real numbers. For example , if A= (—3, 5) and B = [-7, 9], then ACB. The set [ 0, «)
defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set ( — «, 0 ) defines the set of
negative real numbers. The set (—%, « ) describes the set of real numbers in relation
to a line extending from — 2 to «.

On real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of R,
are shown in the Fig 1.1.

(a,b) [a,b] [a,b) (a,b]
—O==O——_-- — ee —_._ — eo 0—__. —_ Oe —_
a b a b a b a b
Fig 1.1

Here, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points.

For example, the set {x : x € R,-5 <x <7}, written in set-builder form, can be
written in the form of interval as (—5, 7] and the interval [—3, 5) can be written in set-
builder form as {x :-3 <x< 5}.

1.7 Universal Set

Usually, in a particular context, we have to deal with the elements and subsets of a
basic set which is relevant to that particular context. For example, while studying the
system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such
as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set
is called the “Universal Set”. The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its
subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc.

For example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational
numbers or, for that matter, the set R of real numbers. For another example, in human
population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world.

1.8 Venn Diagrams

Most of the relationships between sets can be U
represented by means of diagrams which are known
as Venn diagrams. Venn diagrams are named after
the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These
diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves
usually circles. The universal set is represented
usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles.

In Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are
written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3)

Illustration 1 In Fig 1.2, U= {1,2,3,...,10} isthe wy
universal set of which
A= {2,4,6,8,10} is a subset.

Illustration 2 In Fig 1.3, U= {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the
universal set of which

A= {2,4,6,8,10} and B = {4, 6} are subsets,
and alsoB cA.

The reader will see an extensive use of the
Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets.

1.9 Operations on Sets

In earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed
on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the
operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again,
performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65.

Reprint 2025-26

14 MATHEMATICS

Similarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to
another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties.
Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set.

1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set
which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements
being taken only once. The symbol ‘U’ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we
write A U B and usually read as ‘A union B’.

Example 12 Let A= { 2, 4, 6, 8} and B= { 6, 8, 10, 12}. FindA UB.

Solution We have AUB = { 2,4, 6, 8, 10, 12}
Note that the common elements 6 and 8 have been taken only once while writing
AUB.

Example 13 LetA={aei40,u}andB={a, i,u }. Show thatAUB =A

Solution We have, AUB={aei0,u}=A.

This example illustrates that union of sets A and its subset B is the set A
itself, i.e., if BCA, then AUB=A.

Example 14 Let X= {Ram, Geeta, Akbar} be the set of students of Class XI, who are
in school hockey team. Let Y = {Geeta, David, Ashok} be the set of students from
Class XI who are in the school football team. Find X U Y and interpret the set.

Solution We have, X U Y = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar, David, Ashok}. This is the set of
students from Class XI who are in the hockey team or the football team or both.

Thus, we can define the union of two sets as follows:

Definition 5 The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those
elements which are either in A or in B (including
those which are in both). In symbols, we write.
AUB ={x:x cAorx €B}

The union of two sets can be represented by
a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.4.

The shaded portion in Fig 1.4 represents A UB. B

(iv) AUA=A (idempotent law)

(v) UVA =U (Law of U)
1.9.2 Intersection of sets The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements
which are common to both A and B. The symbol ‘7’ is used to denote the intersection.

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to
both A and B. Symbolically, we write A B= {x: x € Aandx € B}.

Example 15 Consider the sets A and B of Example 12. Find An B.

Solution We see that 6, 8 are the only elements which are common to both A and B.
Hence AN B= { 6,8 }.

Example 16 Consider the sets X and Y of Example 14. Find X 1 Y.

Solution We see that element ‘Geeta’ is the only element common to both. Hence,
XO Y= {Geeta}.

Example 17 LetA= {1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and B= { 2,3,5,7}.FindA ™ Band
hence show that AM B= B.

Solution We have An B= { 2, 3, 5, 7 } =B. We
note that B c A and that AN B=B.

Definition 6 The intersection of two sets A and B A
is the set of all those elements which belong to both

Aand B. Symbolically, we write

U

AQB= {x:x e Aandx € B} AAB
The shaded portion in Fig 1.5 indicates the Fig 1.5
intersection of A and B.
If A and B are two sets such that AM B= 9, then |[y
A and B are called disjoint sets.
For example, let A= { 2, 4, 6, 8 } and
B= { 1, 3,5, 7 }. Then A and B are disjoint sets,
because there are no elements which are common to
A and B. The disjoint sets can be represented by
means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6
In the above diagram, A and B are disjoint sets. Fig 1.6

1.9.3 Difference of sets The difference of the sets A and B in this order is the set
of elements which belong to A but not to B. Symbolically, we write A— B and read as
“A minus B”.

Example 18 LetA= { 1, 2,3,4,5,6}, B= { 2,4, 6,8 }. Find A—B and B—A.
Solution We have, A— B= { 1, 3, 5 }, since the elements 1, 3, 5 belong to A but
not to B and B— A= { 8 }, since the element 8 belongs to B and not to A.

We note that A- B4#B-A.

SETS 17

Example 19 Let V = { a, e, i, o, u } and
B={a,i,k, u}. Find V—B and B-V

Solution We have, V—B= { e, o }, since the elements
e, o belong to V but not to B and B— V= { k }, since
the element k belongs to B but not to V.

We note that V- B # B— V. Using the set- | a-B
builder notation, we can rewrite the definition of Fig 1.8
difference as

A-B={x:xeAandx¢€B}

The difference of two sets A and B can be

represented by Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.8.
The shaded portion represents the difference of

the two sets A and B.

Remark The sets A— B, AB and B —- A are
mutually disjoint sets, i.e., the intersection of any of Fig 1.9
these two sets is the null set as shown in Fig 1.9.

1.10 Complement of a Set

Let U be the universal set which consists of all prime numbers and A be the subset of
U which consists of all those prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Thus,
A= {x:x € Uand x is nota divisor of 42 }. We see that 2 € U but 2 ¢ A, because
2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, 3 e¢ U but3 ¢ A, and7 € U but 7 ¢ A. Now 2, 3 and 7 are
the only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers,
ie., the set {2, 3, 7} is called the Complement of A with respect to U, and is denoted by
A’. So we have A’ = {2, 3, 7}. Thus, we see that
A’ = {x:x € Uandx ¢A }. This leads to the following definition.

Definition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of
A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we
write A’ to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus,
A’= {x:x eUandx ¢ A}. Obviously A’ =U-A
We note that the complement of a set A can be looked upon, alternatively, as the
difference between a universal set U and the set A.

SETS 19

Example 20 Let U= {1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} andA= {1, 3,5, 7,9}. Find A’.

Solution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to
A. Hence A’= { 2,4, 6, 8,10 }.

Example 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational
school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A’.

Solution Since A is the set of all girls, A’ is clearly the set of all boys in the class.

If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A’ is also a

subset of U.
Again in Example 20 above, we have A’ = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }

Hence (A’)'= {x : x e Uandx ¢ A}

= {1,3,5,7,9}=A
Itis clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal

set U, we have (A') =

Now, we want to find the results for( AU B )! and A’ 4 B' in the followng
example.

Example 22 Let U= {1, 2,3, 4,5, 6}, A= {2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}.
Find A’, B', A’ (1 B’, AU Band hence show that( AUB )! =A'OB’.

Solution Clearly A’ = {1, 4, 5, 6}, B'= { 1,2, 6}. Hence A’ VB’ = {1,6}
AlsoAUB = { 2,3, 4,5 }, so that(AUB) ={1,6}
(AUB J ={1,6}= A'OB’

It can be shown that the above result is true in general. If A and B are any two
subsets of the universal set U, then

(AUB ) =A'OB". Similarly,(A OB )! = A’ UB’. These two results are stated

in words as follows :
The complement of the union of two sets is U
the intersection of their complements and the A
complement of the intersection of two sets is the
union of their complements. These are called De
Morgan’s laws. These are named after the
mathematician De Morgan.
The complement A’ of a set A can be represented
by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. Fig 1.10

Summary

This chapter deals with some basic definitions and operations involving sets. These

are summarised below:

@ A set is a well-defined collection of objects.

@ A set which does not contain any element is called empty set.

@A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set,
otherwise, the set is called infinite set.

@ Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.

@ Aset A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element
of B. Intervals are subsets of R.

@ The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either
inA or inB.

@ The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are
common. The difference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements
which belong to A but not to B.

© The complement ofa subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U
which are not the elements of A.

@ For any two sets A and B, (A UB)’ =A'O B’ and( ANB)! =A'UB'

Historical Note

The modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the
German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory
appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he
was studying trigonometric series of the form a, sin x + a, sin 2x + a, sin 3x +...
He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into
one-to-one correspondence wih the integers. From 1879 onwards, he publishd
several papers showing various properties of abstract sets.

SETS

Cantor’s work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard
Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding
infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob
Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic.
Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the
set of all sets. It was the famous Englih Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-
1970 ) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets
leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell’s Paradox. Paul R.Halmos
writes about it in his book “Naive Set Theory’ that “nothing contains everything”.

The Russell’s Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory.
Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians.
As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory
was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham
Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of
regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory
axlomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gédel in his
monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gédel-
Bernays (GB) set theory.

Despite all these difficulties, Cantor’s set theory is used in present day
mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics
are expressed in the set theoretic language.
