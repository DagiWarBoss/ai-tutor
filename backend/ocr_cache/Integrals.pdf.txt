7.1 Introduction

Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the
derivative. The original motivation for the derivative was
the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of
functions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral
Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and
calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of
the functions.

If a function f is differentiable in an interval I, 1.e., its
derivative f ‘exists at each point of I, then a natural question
arises that given f’at each point of I, can we determine
the function? The functions that could possibly have given
function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or G .W. Leibnitz
primitive) of the function. Further, the formula that gives (1646 -1716)
all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such
process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in
many practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an
object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the
position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical
situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral
calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:

(a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,

(b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain
conditions.

These two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and
definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus.

There is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, between
indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical
tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting
problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability.

In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite
integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.

7.2 Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation

Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,
we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original
function. Such a process is called integration or anti differentiation.

Let us consider the following examples:

We know that a (sin x) = cos x .. (1)
dx
d x 5
—(—)= . (2
aS 3 )=x (2)
d
and —(e*)=e . GB)
dx

We observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say
3
x
that sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly, in (2) and (3), 3 and

e* are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x* and e*, respectively. Again, we note that
for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we
can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :
d_. d x d
— (sin x+C)=cos x, — (—+C)=x°' and —(e+C)=e"
. x, . . dx 3 . dx . .
Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.

Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which

can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason

C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant. In fact, C is the parameter by

varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.

More generally, if there is a function F such that a F(x) =f (*), vy xe I (interval),

then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration)

Thus, {F+C, C € R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f-

Remark Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let g and h
be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.

Consider the function f= g —h defined by f(x) = g(x) -h(@®), vxel

or f (x) = 0, Vx € I by hypothesis,

1.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence fis constant.

In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F+C, Ce R}
provides all possible anti derivatives of f.

We introduce a new symbol, namely, | f (x) dx which will represent the entire

class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x.
Symbolically, we write | f(x) dx =F(x)+C.

7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral
In this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals.

sense of the following results :

(11) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of
curves and so they are equivalent.

So the families of curves {f f(x) dx+C,,C,e R}

and {[g@ dx+C,,C,€ R} are identical.

Hence, in this sense, } Ff (x) dx and [s@ dx are equivalent.

To find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function
whose derivative is the given function. The search for the requisite function for finding
an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it

through some examples.

Example 1 Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the
method of inspection:

1
(i) cos 2x (ii) 3x2 + 4x3 (ii) ~.x#0

Solution
(i) We look for a function whose derivative is cos 2x. Recall that

— sin 2x = 2 cos 2x

dx

lds a [ sin 2]
or cos 2x = D dk (sin 2x) = dx\2

Therefore, an anti derivative of cos 2x is 3 sin 2x ,

(ii) We look for a function whose derivative is 3x” + 4x°. Note that
d
a (x° +x") = 3x + 4x.

Therefore, an anti derivative of 3x? + 4x3 is x3 + x*.

Example 4 Find the anti derivative F of f defined by f (x) = 4x° — 6, where F (0)
Solution One anti derivative of f (x) is x* — 6x since

4 OA —6x) = 4x3 - 6
dx
Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by

F(x) = x* — 6x + C, where C is constant.

Reprint 2025-26

Given that F(0) = 3, which gives,

3=0-6x0+C or C=3
Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by
F(x) = x* — 6x + 3.
Remarks

(i) We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any
constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write
down an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F
expressed by F(x) +C, Ce R. In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an
additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique
anti derivative of the given function.

(ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial,
logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are

therefore blocked for finding | f (x) dx. For example, it is not possible to find

fe * dx by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is e *

formulae are modified accordingly. For instance

7.3 Methods of Integration

In previous section, we discussed integrals of those functions which were readily
obtainable from derivatives of some functions. It was based on inspection, i.e., on the
search of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f. However,
this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions.
Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals
by reducing them into standard forms. Prominent among them are methods based on:

1. Integration by Substitution
2. Integration using Partial Fractions

3. Integration by Parts

7.3.1 Integration by substitution
In this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution.

The given integral [fr (x) dx can be transformed into another form by changing

the independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (A).

Reprint 2025-26

236 MATHEMATICS

Consider I= | f@)dx

Put x = g(t) so that “ = g(t).

We write dx = g(t) dt

Thus I= [ f() dx=[ f(g) ¢'Oadt

This change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the
name of integration by substitution. It is often important to guess what will be the useful
substitution. Usually, we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs
in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples.

Example 5 Integrate the following functions w.r.t. x:

(i) sin mx (ii) 2x sin (x? + 1)
__ tan* Vx sec? Vx ; sin (tan~' x)
(iii) Tk (vy) “Ty

(i) We know that derivative of mx is m. Thus, we make the substitution
mx = t so that mdx = dt.

Therefore, [sin mx dx =— | sint dt = ——cost+C =— —cosmx+C
m m m

(ii) Derivative of x? + 1 is 2x. Thus, we use the substitution x° + 1 = ¢ so that
2x dx = dt.

Therefore, [2x sin (x* +1) dx = [sin tdt = —cost+C =-cos(’+1)+C

(ii) Derivative of x is —x 7 =

their standard integrals using substitution technique. These will be used later without

integrating products of functions.

If wand v are any two differentiable functions of a single variable x (say). Then, by
the product rule of differentiation, we have

d dv du

— (uv) = u— +v—

Integrating both sides, we get

Let u = f(x) and ke g(x). Then

Reprint 2025-26

Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as

[f@ g@adx = f@O[g@de-[[[g@al fd
ie. [f@g @adx = fg @adx-[If @ [g@ dele

If we take f as the first function and g as the second function, then this formula
may be stated as follows:

“The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) x (integral
of the second function) — Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function)
x (integral of the second function)]”

Example 17 Find fx cos x dx

Solution Put f (x) = x (first function) and g (x) = cos x (second function).
Then, integration by parts gives

[xcos xdx =x [cos x dx — jie [cos x dx] dx

= xsin x— [sin x dx =xsinx+cosx+C

Suppose, we take f(x) =cos x and g(x) = x. Then

[xcos x dx = cos x fx dx ft (0s x) [x dx] dx

Xx ._ Xx

Thus, it shows that the integral fx cos x dx is reduced to the comparatively more

complicated integral having more power of x. Therefore, the proper choice of the first
function and the second function is significant.

Remarks
(i) It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of
functions in all cases. For instance, the method does not work for [vo sin x dx,
The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is

Jx sin x.

(ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add
any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function cos x

as sin x + k, where & is any constant, then

[ xcos x dx = x (sin x+k)— [(sin x+k) de
= x (sin x+k)— [(sin x dx-[k dx

x(sinx+k)—cosx—kx+C = xsin x+cos x+C

This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is
superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of
integration by parts.

(iii) Usually, if any function is a power of x or a polynomial in x, then we take it as the
first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric
function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.

Example 18 Find flog x dx

Solution To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is log x. We
take log x as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function. Then,
the integral of the second function is x.

7.7 Definite Integral
In the previous sections, we have studied about the indefinite integrals and discussed

few methods of finding them including integrals of some special functions. In this
section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral

b
has a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by | f(x) dx, where a is called the

lower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite
integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the
interval [a, b], then its value is the difference between the values of F at the end
points, i.e., F(b) — F(a).

7.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

7.8.1 Area function

b
We have defined | f(x) dx as the area of

the region bounded by the curve y = f(x),
the ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis. Let x

be a given point in [a, b]. Then J . f(x) dx

represents the area of the light shaded region
in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f(x) > 0 for
x € [a, b], the assertion made below is
equally true for other functions as well].
The area of this shaded region depends upon
the value of x.

Y’ Fig 7.1

In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this
function of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function and is given by

A(x) = |. f@)ax .. (1)

Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given.
However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.

7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus

Theorem 1 Let fbe a continuous function on the closed interval [a, b] and let A (x) be
the area function. Then A’(x) =f (x), for all x € [a, b].

7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus

We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals
by making use of anti derivative.

Theorem 2 Let f be continuous function defined on the closed interval [a, b] and F be

an anti derivative of f. Then f° re) dx = [F(x)]2 = F (b) - F@).

Remarks

(i)

(ii)

(iit)

(iv)

Gi)

(ii)

b
In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that } Ff (x) dx = (value of the anti derivative F
of f at the upper limit b — value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a).

This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the
definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.

The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function
whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship
between differentiation and integration.

b
In } f (x) dx, the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [a, 5].

I
For instance, the consideration of definite integral } 5 x(x° —1)? dx is erroneous

1
since the function f expressed by f(x) = x(x° —1)? is not defined in a portion

—1<x< 1 of the closed interval [— 2, 3].
b
Steps for calculating | f(x) dx.
Find the indefinite integral | f (x) dx . Let this be F(x). There is no need to keep
integration constant C because if we consider F(x) + C instead of F(x), we get
b
} F(x) dx =[F (x) + cy’ =[F(b) + C] -[F(a) + C] = Fb) - F(a).

Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite
integral.

Evaluate F(b) — F(a) = [F (x)]? , which is the value of } ° f(x) dx.

In the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite
integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method

of substitution.

b
To evaluate } J (x) dx, by substitution, the steps could be as follows:

1. Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f(x) or x = g(y) to reduce

the given integral to a known form.

2. Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning

the constant of integration.

3. Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original

variable.

4. Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find
the difference of the values at the upper and lower limits.

|= Note |In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After
performing steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3. Here, the integral will be kept

in the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed,
so that we can perform the last step.

Let us illustrate this by examples.

Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. In the differential calculus,
we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of
this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose
differential is given. Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of
differentiation.

Let < F(x) = f(x). Then we write [foo dx =F (x)+C. These integrals

are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of
integration. All these integrals differ by a constant.

A change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the
fundamental integrals. The method in which we change the variable to some
other variable is called the method of substitution. When the integrand involves
some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the
integrals. Using substitution technique, we obtain the following standard
integrals.
