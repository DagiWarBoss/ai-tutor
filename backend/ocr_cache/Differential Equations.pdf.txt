DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

¢ He who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind
seeks for the most part in vain. - D. HILBERT “

9.1 Introduction

In Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book, we
discussed how to differentiate a given function f with respect
to an independent variable, i.e., how to find f’(x) for a given
function f at each x in its domain of definition. Further, in
the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find
a function f whose derivative is the function g, which may
also be formulated as follows:

For a given function g, find a function f such that
dy
ak = g(x), where y = f(x) .. )

An equation of the form (1) is known as a differential Henri Poincare
equation. A formal definition will be given later. (1854-1912 )

These equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Anthropology, Geology, Economics etc. Hence, an indepth study of differential
equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations.

In this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation,
general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential
equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and
some applications of differential equations in different areas.

9.2 Basic Concepts

We are already familiar with the equations of the type:

x -—3x+3=0 . (1)
sin x + cos x = 0 (2)
x+y=7 .. (3)

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 301

Let us consider the equation:

x+y 20 .. (4)

dx
We see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable
(variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent
variable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a

differential equation.

In general, an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable
with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation.

A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect
to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,

2 3
2 ay + (2) = 0 is an ordinary differential equation we (5)

dx dx

Of course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to
more than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this
stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only.
Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential
equation’.

1. We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives:

y Ww

dx? ~

2. For derivatives of higher order, it will be inconvenient to use so many dashes

. . . i. dd”
as supersuffix therefore, we use the notation y, for nth order derivative <* .

9.2.1. Order of a differential equation

Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of
the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given
differential equation.

Consider the following differential equations:

mt) (7)

dy (2
~~ l4?)/52) =0 (8
(< * ae? ®)

The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and
third order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation
To study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential

wr

equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y’, y”, y” etc. Consider the

following differential equations:

2
dy ,(d°y) dy
+2 —-—+y=0 9
dx? ‘S dx » ©)
(2) +(2)-sin’s =0 (10)
dx dx ”
dy. 2)
—+sin} — | =
ax [4 0 .. (1)

We observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y”, y” and y’, equation (10)
is a polynomial equation in y’ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential
equations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y’ and
degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.

By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in
derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order
derivative involved in the given differential equation.

In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7),
(8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of
differential equation (11) is not defined.

Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always
positive integers.

In contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a
function @ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function @ is substituted for the unknown y
(dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.HLS..

The curve y = 6 (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given
differential equation. Consider the function given by

y= (x) =asin (x +d), w. (4)
where a, b € R. When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3),
L.H.S. = R.HLS.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3).

Let a and b be given some particular values say a = 2 and b= re then we get a

function y=O,@)= 2sin{ x+) (5)

Function @ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) a, b and it is called
general solution of the given differential equation. Whereas function , contains no
arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence
is called a particular solution of the given differential equation.

The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution
(primitive) of the differential equation.

The solution free from arbitrary constants 1.e., the solution obtained from the general
solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular
solution of the differential equation.

MATHEMATICS

Summary
An equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to
independent variable (variables) is known as a differential equation.

Order of a differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative
occurring in the differential equation.

Degree of a differential equation is defined if it is a polynomial equation in its
derivatives.

Degree (when defined) of a differential equation is the highest power (positive
integer only) of the highest order derivative in it.

A function which satisfies the given differential equation is called its solution.
The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the
differential equation is called a general solution and the solution free from
arbitrary constants is called particular solution.

Variable separable method is used to solve such an equation in which variables
can be separated completely i.e. terms containing y should remain with dy
and terms containing x should remain with dx.

A differential equation which can be expressed in the form

d d
. =f (x,y) or x = g(x, y) where, f (x, y) and g(x, y) are homogenous
X y

functions of degree zero is called a homogeneous differential equation.
. d
A differential equation of the form =. +Py =Q, where P and Qare constants
I

or functions of x only is called a first order linear differential equation.

Historical Note

One of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations.

Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November,
11,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black

and white the identity } ydy= > y” , thereby introducing both the symbols Jand dy.

Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents
were prescribed. This led him to discover the ‘method of separation of variables’
1691. A year later he formulated the ‘method of solving the homogeneous

Reprint 2025-26

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 337

differential equations of the first order’. He went further in a very short time
to the discovery of the ‘method of solving a linear differential equation of the
first-order’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man
and that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!

In the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was
used to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being
coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first
used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred
years since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare
(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the
word ‘solution’ has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of
the ‘method of separation of variables’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),
a younger brother of James Bernoulli.

Application to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John
Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations.
In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the
differential equation

x y= 2y,

which led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of
cubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking
differential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention
has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of
differential equations, under the heading ‘qualitative analysis of differential
equations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely
necessary in almost all investigations.
