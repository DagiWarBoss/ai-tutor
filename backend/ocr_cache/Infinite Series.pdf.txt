INFINITE SERIES

A.1.1 Introduction

As discussed in the Chapter 9 on Sequences and Series, a sequence d,, d,, ..., 4,5»

n

having infinite number of terms is called infinite sequence and its indicated sum, i.e.,
a,+a,+a,+..+a,+... is called an infinte series associated with infinite sequence.

This series can also be expressed in abbreviated form using the sigma notation, 1.e.,

ioe)
a,ta,+a,+... bat... = Dm

k=1

In this Chapter, we shall study about some special types of series which may be
required in different problem situations.

A.1.2 Binomial Theorem forany Index

In Chapter 8, we discussed the Binomial Theorem in which the index was a positive
integer. In this Section, we state a more general form of the theorem in which the
index is not necessarily a whole number. It gives us a particular type of infinite series,
called Binomial Series. We illustrate few applications, by examples.

We know the formula

(l+xy"="C, t"C, xt... +"C, x"

Here, 7 is non-negative integer. Observe that if we replace index n by negative

integer or a fraction, then the combinations "C, do not make any sense.

We now state (without proof), the Binomial Theorem, giving an infinite series in
which the index is negative or a fraction and not a whole number.

Theorem The formula

Remark 1. Note carefully the condition | x | < 1, i.e.,-— 1<x< 1 is necessary when m
is negative integer or a fraction. For example, if we take x = — 2 andm = —2, we
obtain

(1-2)° =14+ (-2)(-2) + 2) ay $a

or 1=1+4+4+12+...
This is not possible

is a negative integer or a fraction

A.1.3 Infinite Geometric Series

aT (constant) for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1. Particularly, if we take a, = a, then the
k

resulting sequence a, ar, ar’, ..., ar”! is taken as the standard form of G.P., where a is

first term and r, the common ratio of G.P.

We observe that as n becomes larger and larger, (5) becomes closer and closer to

zero. Mathematically, we say that as n becomes sufficiently large, G becomes

sufficiently small. In other words, as 7 ©, (3) — 0. Consequently, we find that

the sum of infinitely many terms is given by S=3.
Thus, for infinite geometric progression a, ar, ar’, ..., ifnumerical value of common

A.1.4 Exponential Series
Leonhard Euler (1707 — 1783), the great Swiss mathematician introduced the number
e in his calculus text in 1748. The number e is useful in calculus as zx in the study of the
circle.

Consider the following infinite series of numbers

1 n 1 1 n 1
The sum of the series given in (1) is denoted by the number e
Let us estimate the value of the number e.

Since every term of the series (1) is positive, itis clear that its sum is also positive.
Consider the two sums

hence 2<e <3.

Another very important series is logarithmic series which 1s also in the form of infinite
series. We state the following result without proof and illustrate its application with an

example.
